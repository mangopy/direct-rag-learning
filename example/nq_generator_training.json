She produced the miniseries, along with her co-star, Nicole Kidman, and the show's director, Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e, her second project under his direction. The series premiered on February 19, 2017 on HBO and finished on April 2. Witherspoon has garnered critical acclaim for her performance, with TV Line proclaiming her as \"\"Performer of the Week\"\" of February 26 to March 4.\n[2] Title: \"The Big O\" Text:  The first season is episodic. Each episode (referred to as an \"\"Act\"\") relates a separate instance the resurgence of lost \"\"memories\"\" and how the citizens cope with their collective amnesia. The final episodes introduce elements that come into play during season two, like the discovery of people living outside of Paradigm City, the true nature of the Event, and something obliquely described as \"\"the Power of God wielded by the hand of man\"\".

The distinctive synthesizer theme was performed by the then-little-known Thomas Dolby, and this song also marked a major departure from their earlier singles because their previous singles were mid to upper tempo rock songs while this song was a softer love song with the energy of a power ballad. It was the second single released from the album \"\"4\"\" (1981) and was co-written by Lou Gramm and Mick Jones.\n[2] Title: \"Waiting for a Girl Like You\" Text:  The song was the band's biggest hit until \"\"I Want to Know What Love Is\"\" hit number 1 in 1985.

Because of its chart longevity, it ended up being the number 19 song on the Top 100 singles of 1982.\n[5] Title: \"Lou Gramm\" Text:  He co-wrote most of the songs for the band, which achieved two of its biggest hits with the ballads \"\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\"\", which spent ten weeks at #2 on the 1981/82 American Hot 100, and \"\"I Want to Know What Love Is\"\", which was a #1 hit internationally (US & UK) in 1985.

Arctic Norway consists of four geographically separated parts: The Arctic circle crosses mainland Norway at Saltfjellet, which separates Helgeland from the northern part of Nordland county. Thus about half of the county lies north of the Arctic circle, along with the whole of Troms and Finnmark counties.\n[2] Title: \"Arctic Norway\" Text:  Jan Mayen is situated some 880 km northwest of mainland Norway and about 450 km off the coast of Greenland.

Notable peaks in Salten are the B\u00f8rvasstindan south of Bod\u00f8, Suliskongen near Fauske (, highest mountain north of the Arctic Circle), the Steigartindan and the phallic Hamar\u00f8ytinden. Between Saltfjellet and eastern Finnmark, Norway spruce trees have originally been planted and are mostly privately owned. The older plantations are now producing lumber, 80 years after planted. Lofoten is a chain of peaks that jut out of the ocean.\n[4] Title: Nordland Text:  Norway's second-largest glacier, Svartisen, the second-largest lake, R\u00f8ssvatnet, and the second-deepest fjord, Tysfjord (897 m) are all located in Nordland. The largest river (waterflow) is Vefsna which forms the Laksforsen waterfall. The Saltfjellet mountain range forms a natural border between Helgeland and Salten, and is where the Arctic Circle cuts through the county. The western part of this mountain range is dominated by steep mountains and fjord inlets, with glaciers stretching towards the sea, while the eastern part of the mountains is more gentle and rounded, with some forested valleys, and is well suited for hiking.\n[5] Title: \"Northern Norway\" Text:  Northern Norway covers about a third of Norway. The southernmost part, roughly the part south of the Arctic Circle, is called Helgeland. Here there is a multitude of islands and skerries on the outside of the coastal range, some flat, some with impressive shapes, like Mount Torghatten, which has a hole through it, and the Seven Sisters near Sandnessj\u00f8en. The inland is covered with dense spruce forests and mountains near the Swedish border; some of the biggest rivers in the region are the Vefsna and the Ranelva.

The story has appeared in several adaptations starting with 1973's \"\"Dr. Seuss on the Loose\"\" starring Paul Winchell as the voice of both Sam-I-am and the first-person narrator. The story follows a strange creature who does not like green eggs and ham and his friend Sam-I-Am who wants him to eat it. The story becomes a refrain as Sam persistently follows his friend through an assortment of locations (in a house, in a box, in a car, in a tree, on a train, in the dark, in the rain, on a boat) and dining partners (a mouse, a fox, and a goat).\n[2] Title: \"Dr. Seuss on the Loose\" Text:  Dr. Seuss on the Loose Dr. Seuss on the Loose (titled Green Eggs and Ham and Other Stories for the sing-a-long videocasette release and the deluxe edition releases) is an animated musical television special, first airing on CBS on October 15, 1973, and hosted by The Cat in the Hat who appears in bridging sequences where he introduced animated adaptations of Dr. Seuss children's stories \"\"The Sneetches\"\", \"\"The Zax\"\" and \"\"Green Eggs and Ham\"\".

Thank you. Thank you, Sam-I-am.\"\" \"\"Green Eggs and Ham\"\" is one of Seuss's \"\"Beginner Books\"\", written in a very simple vocabulary for beginning readers. The vocabulary of the text consists of just 50 words and was the result of a bet between Seuss and Bennett Cerf, Dr. Seuss's publisher, that Seuss (after completing \"\"The Cat in the Hat\"\" using 236 words) could not complete an entire book without exceeding that limit.\n[4] Title: \"Green Eggs and Ham\" Text:  The 50 words are: a, am, and, anywhere, are, be, boat, box, car, could, dark, do, eat, eggs, fox, goat, good, green, ham, here, house, I, if, in, let, like, may, me, mouse, not, on, or, rain, Sam, say, see, so, thank, that, the, them, there, they, train, tree, try, will, with, would, you.\n[5] Title: \"Green Eggs and Ham\" Text:  Muirhead ordered the egg destroyed and rendered his judgment in the style of Seuss. Senator Ted Cruz read the book on the floor of the United States Senate during his filibuster over the funding over Obamacare. Musician will.i.am has stated that his moniker is inspired by the story. On September 29, 1991, following Dr. Seuss' death earlier that week, the Reverend Jesse Jackson recited an excerpt of \"\"Green Eggs and Ham\"\" on \"\"Saturday Night Live\"\" during a special tribute segment.

He was reportedly recommended by co-star Johnny Depp, with whom Highmore had worked in \"\"Finding Neverland\"\"; Depp had been impressed by the young actor's performance and thus put his name forward for the role. Highmore had not seen the original 1971 version of the film, and decided not to see it until he was done filming so his portrayal of Charlie would not be influenced.\n[2] Title: \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)\" Text:  Filming took place from June to December 2004 at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom. \"\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"\" was released to positive critical reception and was a box office success, grossing $475 million worldwide. Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a poor boy who lives near the Wonka Candy Company. The company's owner, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp), has for long closed access to his factory due to problems concerning industrial espionage that led him to fire all his employees, among them Charlie's Grandpa Joe (David Kelly).\n[3] Title: \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)\" Text:  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a 2005 musical fantasy comedy film directed by Tim Burton and written by John August, based on the 1964 British novel of the same name by Roald Dahl. The film stars Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka and Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket. The storyline follows Charlie, who wins a contest and, along with four other contest winners, is led by Wonka on a tour of his chocolate factory, the most magnificent in the world. Development for a second adaptation of \"\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"\" (filmed previously as \"\"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\"\" in 1971) began in 1991, which resulted in Warner Bros. providing the Dahl Estate with total artistic control.\n[4] Title: \"Finding Neverland (film)\" Text:  Highmore's performance in this film led Johnny Depp to suggest him to Tim Burton for \"\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"\", in which Highmore played Charlie Bucket and Depp played Willy Wonka.

Starring Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket and Deep Roy as the Oompa-Loompas, the film generally took a more faithful approach to the source material than the 1971 adaptation, \"\"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\"\", although some liberties were taken, such as adding Wonka's issue with his father (played by Christopher Lee).\nQuestion: who played charlie bucket in the original charlie and the chocolate factory\nYour answer: ",

Queen Elizabeth II is the sovereign, and her heir apparent is her eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales. Next in line after him is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, the Prince of Wales's elder son. Third in line is Prince George, the eldest child of the Duke of Cambridge, followed by his sister, Princess Charlotte and younger brother, Prince Louis. Sixth in line is Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, the younger son of the Prince of Wales.\n[2] Title: \"Charles II of England\" Text:  Charles faced a political storm over his brother James, a Catholic, being next in line to the throne. The prospect of a Catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (previously Baron Ashley and a member of the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1673). Shaftesbury's power base was strengthened when the House of Commons of 1679 introduced the Exclusion Bill, which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the line of succession. Some even sought to confer the Crown on the Protestant Duke of Monmouth, the eldest of Charles's illegitimate children.\n[3] Title: \"William III of England\" Text:  The Bill of Rights also settled the question of succession to the Crown. After the death of either William or Mary, the other would continue to reign. Next in the line of succession was Mary II's sister, Anne, and her issue, followed by any children William might have had by a subsequent marriage. Roman Catholics, as well as those who married Catholics, were excluded. Although most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a significant minority refused to acknowledge their claim to the throne, instead believing in the divine right of kings, which held that the monarch's authority derived directly from God rather than being delegated to the monarch by Parliament.\n[4] Title: \"Mary II of England\" Text:  The Bill of Rights also confirmed the succession to the throne. Following the death of either William III or Mary II, the other was to continue to reign. Next in the line of succession would be any children of the couple, to be followed by Mary's sister Anne and her children. Last in the line of succession stood any children William III might have had from any subsequent marriage. From 1690 onwards, William was often absent from England on campaign, each year generally from the spring until the autumn. In 1690, he fought Jacobites (who supported James) in Ireland.\n[5] Title: Monarchy Text:  Religion can be a factor in the eligibility of a monarch; for example the British monarch, as head of the Church of England, is required to be in communion with the Church, although all other former rules forbidding marriage to non-Protestants were abolished when equal primogeniture was adopted in 2013. In the case of the absence of children, the next most senior member of the collateral line (for example, a younger sibling of the previous monarch) becomes monarch. In complex cases, this can mean that there are closer blood relatives to the deceased monarch than the next in line according to primogeniture.\nQuestion: who is next in line to be the monarch of england\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"United States Civil Service Commission\" Text:  The Pendleton law was passed in part due to public outcry over the assassination of President Garfield. The Pendleton Act renewed funding for the Civil Service Commission and established a three-man commission to run Civil Service whose commissioners were chosen by President Arthur. The Civil Service Commission administered the civil service of the United States federal government. The Pendleton law required certain applicants to take the civil service exam in order to be given certain jobs; it also prevented elected officials and political appointees from firing civil servants, removing civil servants from the influences of political patronage and partisan behavior.\n[2] Title: \"Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act\" Text:  Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act (ch. 27, ) is a United States federal law enacted in 1883 that mandated that positions within the federal government should be awarded on the basis of merit instead of political affiliation. The act provided selection of government employees by competitive exams, rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation. It also made it illegal to fire or demote government officials for political reasons and prohibited soliciting campaign donations on Federal government property. To enforce the merit system and the judicial system, the law also created the United States Civil Service Commission.\n[3] Title: \"United States federal civil service\" Text:  The United States Civil Service Commission was created by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, which was passed into law on January 16, 1883. The commission was created to administer the civil service of the United States federal government. The law required federal government employees to be selected through competitive exams and basis of merit; it also prevented elected officials and political appointees from firing civil servants, removing civil servants from the influences of political patronage and partisan behavior. However, the law did not apply to state and municipal governments. Effective January 1, 1978, the commission was renamed the Office of Personnel Management under the provisions of Reorganization Plan No.\n[4] Title: \"Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act\" Text:  This board would be in charge of determining the rules and regulations of the act. The act also allowed for the president, by executive order, to decide which positions would be subject to the act and which would not. A result was the shift of the parties to reliance on funding from business, since they could no longer depend on patronage. In 1877, there was growing interest in the United States concerning the effects of the spoils system on the American political system. New York City established the Civil Service Reform Association to help address the issues, which would lead to several other organizations like it appearing in other cities.\n[5] Title: Patronage Text:  At times he was a member of the United States House of Representatives, the New York City Board of Advisors, and the New York State Senate. In 1873, Tweed was convicted for diverting between $40 million and $200 million of public monies. Six months after James Garfield became president in 1881, Charles J. Guiteau, a disappointed office-seeker, assassinated him. To prevent further political violence and to assuage public outrage, Congress passed the Pendleton Act in 1883, which set up the Civil Service Commission. Henceforth, applicants for most federal government jobs would have to pass an examination.\nQuestion: who is in charge of enforcing the pendleton act of 1883\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Spanish\u2013American War\" Text:  Before the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), Southern interests attempted to have the United States purchase Cuba and convert it into a new slave territory. The pro-slavery element proposed the Ostend Manifesto proposal of 1854. It was rejected by anti-slavery forces. After the American Civil War and Cuba's Ten Years' War, U.S. businessmen began monopolizing the devalued sugar markets in Cuba. In 1894, 90% of Cuba's total exports went to the United States, which also provided 40% of Cuba's imports. Cuba's total exports to the U.S. were almost twelve times larger than the export to her mother country, Spain.\n[2] Title: \"Spanish\u2013American War\" Text:  It funded and smuggled weapons. It mounted a large propaganda campaign that generated enormous popular support in the U.S. in favor of the Cubans. Protestant churches and most Democrats were supportive, but business interests called on Washington to negotiate a settlement and avoid war. Cuba attracted enormous American attention, but almost no discussion involved the other Spanish colonies of the Philippines, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Historians note that there was no popular demand in the United States for an overseas colonial empire\u2014Americans did not admire the British Empire or the others.\n[3] Title: \"Spanish\u2013American War\" Text:  Other American business concerns, specifically those who had invested in Cuban sugar, looked to the Spanish to restore order. Stability, not war, was the goal of both interests. How stability would be achieved would depend largely on the ability of Spain and the U.S. to work out their issues diplomatically. While tension increased among the Cubans and Spanish Government, popular support of intervention began to spring up in the United States, due to the emergence of the \"\"Cuba Libre\"\" movement and the fact that many Americans had drawn parallels between the American Revolution and the Cuban revolt, seeing the Spanish Government as the tyrannical colonial oppressor.\n[4] Title: \"Spanish\u2013American War\" Text:  Both papers denounced Spain, but had little influence outside New York. American opinion generally saw Spain as a hopelessly backward power that was unable to deal fairly with Cuba. American Catholics were divided before the war began, but supported it enthusiastically once it started. The U.S. had important economic interests that were being harmed by the prolonged conflict and deepening uncertainty about the future of Cuba. Shipping firms that had relied heavily on trade with Cuba now suffered losses as the conflict continued unresolved. These firms pressed Congress and McKinley to seek an end to the revolt.\n[5] Title: \"History of Cuba\" Text:  It has also been argued that the main reason the United States entered the war was the failed secret attempt, in 1896, to purchase Cuba from a weaker, war-depleted Spain. Hostilities started hours after the declaration of war when a U.S. contingent under Admiral William T. Sampson blockaded several Cuban ports. The Americans decided to invade Cuba and to start in Oriente where the Cubans had almost absolute control and were able to co-operate, for example, by establishing a beachhead and protecting the U.S. landing in Daiquiri. The first U.S. objective was to capture the city of Santiago de Cuba in order to destroy Linares' army and Cervera's fleet.\nQuestion: why was there so much interest in cuba both before and after the civil war\nYour answer: ",

Veterans Day is distinct from Memorial Day, a U.S. public holiday in May. Veterans Day celebrates the service of all U.S. military veterans, while Memorial Day honors those who \"\"died\"\" while in military service. There is another military holiday, Armed Forces Day, a minor U.S. remembrance that also occurs in May, which honors those \"\"currently serving\"\" in the U.S. military. On November 11, 1919, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson issued a message to his countrymen on the first Armistice Day, in which he expressed what he felt the day meant to Americans: The United States Congress adopted a resolution on June 4, 1926, requesting that President Calvin Coolidge issue annual proclamations calling for the observance of November 11 with appropriate ceremonies.\n[2] Title: \"Veterans Day\" Text:  It had been eight and a half years since Weeks held his first Armistice Day celebration for all veterans. Congress amended the bill on June 1, 1954, replacing \"\"Armistice\"\" with \"\"Veterans,\"\" and it has been known as Veterans Day since. The National Veterans Award was also created in 1954. Congressman Rees of Kansas received the first National Veterans Award in Birmingham, Alabama, for his support offering legislation to make Veterans Day a federal holiday. Although originally scheduled for celebration on November 11 of every year, starting in 1971 in accordance with the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, Veterans Day was moved to the fourth Monday of October (October 25, 1971; October 23, 1972; October 22, 1973; October 28, 1974; October 27, 1975; October 25, 1976, and October 24, 1977).\n[3] Title: \"Veterans Day\" Text:  A Congressional Act (52 Stat. 351; 5 U.S. Code, Sec. 87a) approved May 13, 1938, made November 11 in each year a legal holiday: \"\"a day to be dedicated to the cause of world peace and to be thereafter celebrated and known as 'Armistice Day'.\"\" In 1945, World War II veteran Raymond Weeks from Birmingham, Alabama, had the idea to expand Armistice Day to celebrate all veterans, not just those who died in World War I. Weeks led a delegation to Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, who supported the idea of National Veterans Day.\n[4] Title: \"Veterans Day\" Text:  Veterans Day Veterans Day (originally known as Armistice Day) is an official United States public holiday observed annually on November 11, honoring military veterans, that is, persons who have served in the United States Armed Forces. It coincides with other holidays including Armistice Day and Remembrance Day which are celebrated in other countries that mark the anniversary of the end of World War I. Major hostilities of World War I were formally ended at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, when the Armistice with Germany went into effect.\n[5] Title: \"Veterans Day\" Text:  While the holiday is commonly printed as \"\"Veteran's Day\"\" or \"\"Veterans' Day\"\" in calendars and advertisements (spellings that are grammatically acceptable), the United States Department of Veterans Affairs website states that the attributive (no apostrophe) rather than the possessive case is the official spelling \"\"because it is not a day that 'belongs' to veterans, it is a day for honoring all veterans.\"\" Veterans Day Veterans Day (originally known as Armistice Day) is an official United States public holiday observed annually on November 11, honoring military veterans, that is, persons who have served in the United States Armed Forces.\nQuestion: when did veterans day start being called veterans day\nYour answer: ",

France's Karine Ruby was the first ever to win an Olympic gold medal for Woman's Snowboarding at the 1998 Olympics, while Canadian Ross Rebagliati was the first ever to win an Olympic gold medal for Men's Snowboarding. Initially, ski areas adopted the sport at a much slower pace than the winter sports public. Indeed, for many years, there was animosity between skiers and snowboarders, which led to an ongoing skier vs snowboarder feud.\n[5] Title: \"International Snowboard Federation\" Text:  The ISF set the standard for snowboarding competition, which contributed to the development of it as an Olympic sport in the 1998 Winter Olympics. In a controversial move, the International Olympic Committee recognized the International Ski Federation (FIS) as the sport's official governing body. Three-time world champion Terje H\u00e5konsen boycotted the Olympics as a result of the FIS being appointed to oversee the officiating. Other riders followed in H\u00e5konsen's footsteps and concluded FIS rules to be inappropriate for snowboarding.

Berra appeared in fourteen World Series, including 10 World Series championships, both of which are records. In part because Berra's playing career coincided with the Yankees' most consistent period of World Series participation, he established Series records for the most games (75), at bats (259), hits (71), doubles (10), singles (49), games caught (63), and catcher putouts (457).\n[2] Title: \"Phil Rizzuto\" Text:  At the time of his last game, he had also appeared in the most World Series games ever (52), a record soon surpassed by five of his Yankees teammates.

In the 1860s Odling, like many chemists, was working towards classifying the elements, an effort that would eventually lead to the periodic table of elements. He was intrigued by atomic weights and the periodic occurrence of chemical properties. William Odling and Lothar Meyer drew up tables similar, but with improvements on, Dmitri Mendeleev's original table. Odling drew up a table of elements using repeating units of seven elements, which bears a striking resemblance to Mendeleev's first table.\n[2] Title: \"History of the periodic table\" Text:  In 1864, the English chemist William Odling also drew up a table that was remarkably similar to the table produced by Mendeleev. Odling overcame the tellurium-iodine problem and even managed to get thallium, lead, mercury and platinum into the right groups, which is something that Mendeleev failed to do at his first attempt. Odling failed to achieve recognition, however, since it is suspected that he, as Secretary of the Chemical Society of London, was instrumental in discrediting Newlands' earlier work on the periodic table. By 1912 almost 50 different radioactive elements had been found, too many for the periodic table.\n[3] Title: \"John Newlands (chemist)\" Text:  In 1868 he became chief chemist of James Duncan's London sugar refinery, where he introduced a number of improvements in processing. Later he quit the refinery and again became an analyst with his brother, Benjamin. Newlands was the first person to devise a periodic table of chemical elements arranged in order of their relative atomic masses. Continuing Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner's work with triads and Jean-Baptiste Dumas' families of similar elements, he published in 1865 his 'Law of Octaves', which stated that 'any given element will exhibit analogous behaviour to the eighth element following it in the table.'\n[4] Title: \"History of the periodic table\" Text:  As a result, de Chancourtois' ideas received little attention until after the work of Dmitri Mendeleev had been published. In 1864, the English chemist John Newlands classified the sixty-two known elements into eight groups, based on their physical properties. Newlands noted that many pairs of similar elements existed, which differed by some multiple of eight in mass number, and was the first to assign them an atomic number. When his 'law of octaves' was printed in \"\"Chemistry News\"\", likening this periodicity of eights to the musical scale, it was ridiculed by some of his contemporaries.\n[5] Title: \"History of chemistry\" Text:  The subsequent proof of many of his predictions within his lifetime brought fame to Mendeleev as the founder of the periodic law. This organization surpassed earlier attempts at classification by Alexandre-\u00c9mile B\u00e9guyer de Chancourtois, who published the telluric helix, an early, three-dimensional version of the periodic table of the elements in 1862, John Newlands, who proposed the law of octaves (a precursor to the periodic law) in 1864, and Lothar Meyer, who developed an early version of the periodic table with 28 elements organized by valence in 1864.

In early 2012, the \"\"Lab Rats\"\" premiere received the highest ratings for original series for the network. It was announced in May 2012, that it had officially picked up for another season. Sparks had made appearances on various television programs from as early as 1994, when he played a long-haired skateboarder on the fourteenth episode of the first season of \"\"\"\".\n[3] Title: \"Lab Rats (UK TV series)\" Text:  Lab Rats (UK TV series) Lab Rats is a 2008 BBC Two situation comedy set in a university science laboratory starring Chris Addison, who co-wrote the series with Carl Cooper. The series was produced by regular collaborator Simon Nicholls and directed by Adam Tandy. Its executive producer was Armando Iannucci with whom Addison worked in \"\"The Thick of It\"\". Iannucci stated that the programme would be a traditional-style sitcom recorded in front of a live audience. He hinted that it will be a \"\"very cartoony\"\" show featuring \"\"lots of giant snails\"\".\n[4] Title: \"Chris Addison\" Text:  He appeared in all episodes of the first three series, as well as the two specials 'Rise of the Nutters' and 'Spinners and Losers'. Chris Addison reprised his role as Ollie when \"\"The Thick of It\"\" returned for a fourth series. Addison also featured in the film spin-off of \"\"The Thick of It\"\", titled \"\"In the Loop\"\", playing Toby Wright, a character very similar to his part in the television original. In July 2008, BBC Two aired \"\"Lab Rats\"\", a sitcom starring Addison and co-written with Carl Cooper.\n[5] Title: \"Chris Addison\" Text:  \"\"Lab Rats\"\" featured cast members Jo Enright, Geoffrey McGivern and Dan Tetsell, with whom Addison had worked previously on the radio adaptations of his one-man shows \"\"The Ape That Got Lucky\"\" and \"\"Civilisation\"\". \"\"Lab Rats\"\" was a return to the traditional, joke-heavy, studio based sitcom format that has fallen out of fashion in recent times in favour of the single-camera sitcom. The series was not generally well received by critics and was not renewed for a second series.\nQuestion: who plays skyler on lab rats elite force\nYour answer: ",

The broadcasts increased spectator turnout for live matches. For the 1949\u20131950 season, Seltzer formed the National Roller Derby League (NRDL), comprising six teams. NRDL season playoffs sold out Madison Square Garden for a week. During the late 1950s and 1960s, the sport was broadcast on several networks, but attendance declined. Jerry Seltzer (Leo's son), the \"\"Roller Derby\"\" \"\"commissioner\"\", hoped to use television to expand the live spectator base.\n[2] Title: \"Leo Seltzer\" Text:  Seltzer's game and traveling troupe of skaters evolved and continued to have moderate growth, but it was not until November 29, 1948, when Roller Derby, broadcast on television from New York City's 69th Regiment Armory, captivated the nation. Roller Derby was finally the smash hit Leo Seltzer had always envisioned, although within a few years, the sport was overexposed on TV, the brand new medium that had catapulted it to prominence. With dwindling attendance, Roller Derby left America to tour Europe in 1953, but returned the following year.\n[3] Title: \"Chicago Coliseum\" Text:  With the Blackhawks gone and the Great Depression in full swing, use of the arena was limited. In 1935, promoter Leo Seltzer, drawing on the Depression-era popularity of roller skating, conceived the idea of a Roller Derby. In 1935, he staged the world's first Roller Derby at the arena. The event drew more than 20,000 people. Over its history, the Coliseum featured a wide variety of other events that included the 1915 Lincoln Jubilee, which celebrated 50-years since the abolition of slavery in the U.S.; sessions of the 28th International Eucharistic Congress in June 1926; bowling tournaments; professional wrestling bouts that included stars Gorgeous George and Angelo Poffo; circuses meetings of Black Muslims; Black Panthers and the last convention of the radical antiwar organization Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in June 1969.\n[4] Title: \"Leo Seltzer\" Text:  336652), and on August 13, 1935, twenty thousand spectators filled the Chicago Coliseum to see 'Colonel' Leo Seltzer's Transcontinental Roller Derby, a mythical marathon race from one end of the country to the other which incorporated both male and female participants on a banked track. Seltzer's decision to use women was a double-edged sword for the sport, since it guaranteed a large female audience at a sporting event, but the presence of women athletes made the mainstream press view Roller Derby as a sideshow, not a legitimate sport.\n[5] Title: \"Leo Seltzer\" Text:  Discussing the article with some of the regulars at Ricketts, a restaurant in Chicago's Near North Side, Seltzer was challenged to come up with a sport utilizing roller skating participants. Bicycle races and dance marathons were very popular at the time, and in previous decades there had been successful 24-hour and multi-day roller skating races, at least one of which was called a \"\"roller derby\"\" in the press. Seltzer began jotting ideas onto the tablecloth, incorporating these popular entertainment forms with a roller skating theme.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Genetic drift\" Text:  The direction of the random change in allele frequency is autocorrelated across generations. The Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle states that within sufficiently large populations, the allele frequencies remain constant from one generation to the next unless the equilibrium is disturbed by migration, genetic mutations, or selection. However, in finite populations, no new alleles are gained from the random sampling of alleles passed to the next generation, but the sampling can cause an existing allele to disappear. Because random sampling can remove, but not replace, an allele, and because random declines or increases in allele frequency influence expected allele distributions for the next generation, genetic drift drives a population towards genetic uniformity over time.\n[2] Title: \"Allele frequency\" Text:  Population genetics describes the genetic composition of a population, including allele frequencies, and how allele frequencies are expected to change over time. The Hardy-Weinberg law describes the expected equilibrium genotype frequencies in a diploid population after random mating. Random mating alone does not change allele frequencies, and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumes an infinite population size and a selectively neutral locus. In natural populations natural selection (adaptation mechanism), gene flow, and mutation combine to change allele frequencies across generations. Genetic drift causes changes in allele frequency from random sampling due to offspring number variance in a finite population size, with small populations experiencing larger per generation fluctuations in frequency than large populations.\n[3] Title: \"Genetic diversity\" Text:  This low genetic diversity also has geneticists concerned for the koalas ability to adapt to climate change and human-induced environmental changes in the future. Large populations are more likely to maintain genetic material and thus generally have higher genetic diversity. Small populations are more likely to experience the loss of diversity over time by random chance, which is called genetic drift. When an allele (variant of a gene) drifts to fixation, the other allele at the same locus is lost, resulting in a loss in genetic diversity. In small population sizes, inbreeding, or mating between individuals with similar genetic makeup, is more likely to occur, thus perpetuating more common alleles to the point of fixation, thus decreasing genetic diversity.\n[4] Title: \"Genetic drift\" Text:  When an allele reaches a frequency of 1 (100%) it is said to be \"\"fixed\"\" in the population and when an allele reaches a frequency of 0 (0%) it is lost. Smaller populations achieve fixation faster, whereas in the limit of an infinite population, fixation is not achieved. Once an allele becomes fixed, genetic drift comes to a halt, and the allele frequency cannot change unless a new allele is introduced in the population via mutation or gene flow. Thus even while genetic drift is a random, directionless process, it acts to eliminate genetic variation over time.\n[5] Title: \"Genetic drift\" Text:  In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck. The probabilities for the number of copies of allele A (or B) that survive (given in the last column of the above table) can be calculated directly from the binomial distribution where the \"\"success\"\" probability (probability of a given allele being present) is 1/2 (i.e., the probability that there are \"\"k\"\" copies of A (or B) alleles in the combination) is given by where \"\"n=4\"\" is the number of surviving bacteria.\nQuestion: if there is a random change in the genetics of a small population it is termed\nYour answer: ",

Carr was born Charmian Anne Farnon in Chicago, Illinois, the second child of vaudeville actress Rita Oehmen and musician Brian Farnon. The couple divorced in 1957. She had two sisters, both actresses (Shannon Farnon and Darleen Carr). Her family moved to Los Angeles when she was 10.\n[2] Title: \"First Impressions (musical)\" Text:  Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II cast her in the role of Liesl, the eldest daughter, in the 1959 original Broadway production of \"\"The Sound of Music\"\". Peters shared a Tony Award nomination for the role, and stayed with the show for two years. Like the novel, the musical is concerned primarily with the rocky courtship between Elizabeth Bennet, a poor gentleman's daughter with four sisters, and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, a wealthy aristocrat who arrives in Miss Elizabeth's rural village in 1813. The course of true love is hindered by minor character flaws on both sides\u2014his pride and reserve, which look like arrogance to her, and her tendency to jump to erroneous conclusions based on little evidence, as well as her verbal assertiveness, which mildly scandalizes him.\n[3] Title: \"Sophie Bould\" Text:  It\u2019s a strange but lovely feeling\"\". Bould graduated with a first class degree from Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts, having earlier attended the National Youth Theatre.

Bould appeared in the West End at the London Palladium in the original Andrew Lloyd Webber production of \"\"The Sound of Music\"\", alongside Connie Fisher. Bould played the eldest child of the Von Trapp family, \"\"Liesl\"\".\n[4] Title: \"The Sound of Music (film)\" Text:  The character of Friedrich (the second oldest child in the film version) was based on Rupert, the oldest of the real von Trapp children. Liesl (the oldest child in the film) was based on Agathe von Trapp, the second oldest in the real family. The names and ages of the children were changed, in part because the third child (who would be portrayed as \"\"Louisa\"\") was also named Maria, and producers thought that it would be confusing to have two characters called Maria in the film.\n[5] Title: \"The Sound of Music (film)\" Text:  Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. Liesl, the oldest, is won over after Maria protects her from discovery when she is nearly caught sneaking back into the house after meeting with Rolfe, a messenger boy she is in love with. While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and teaches them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend, Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns.\nQuestion: who played the eldest daughter in the sound of music\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Physical body\" Text:  In classical mechanics a physical body is collection of matter having properties including mass, velocity, momentum and energy. The matter exists in a volume of three-dimensional space. This space is its extension. Under Newtonian gravity the gravitational field further away than the furthest extent of an object is determined only by the mass and the position of the center of mass. Interactions between objects are partly described by orientation and external shape. In continuum mechanics an object may be described as a collection of sub objects, down to an infinitesimal division, which interact with each other by forces which may be described internally by pressure and mechanical stress.\n[2] Title: \"Continuum mechanics\" Text:  Continuum mechanics Continuum mechanics is a branch of mechanics that deals with the mechanical behavior of materials modeled as a continuous mass rather than as discrete particles. The French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy was the first to formulate such models in the 19th century. Modeling an object as a continuum assumes that the substance of the object completely fills the space it occupies. Modeling objects in this way ignores the fact that matter is made of atoms, and so is not continuous; however, on length scales much greater than that of inter-atomic distances, such models are highly accurate.\n[3] Title: \"Infinite divisibility\" Text:  The multiplicity of a material object\u2014the number of its parts\u2014depends on the existence, not of delimiting surfaces, but of internal spatial relations (relative positions between parts), and these lack determinate values. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, the particles that make up an atom\u2014quarks and electrons\u2014are point particles: they do not take up space. What makes an atom nevertheless take up space is \"\"not\"\" any spatially extended \"\"stuff\"\" that \"\"occupies space\"\", and that might be cut into smaller and smaller pieces, \"\"but\"\" the indeterminacy of its internal spatial relations.\n[4] Title: \"Physical body\" Text:  An object has an identity. In general two objects with identical properties, other than position at an instance in time, may be distinguished as two objects and may not occupy the same space at the same time (excluding component objects). An object's identity may be tracked using the continuity of the change in its boundary over time. The identity of objects allows objects to be arranged in sets and counted. The material in an object may change over time. For example, a rock may wear away or have pieces broken off it.\n[5] Title: Chemistry Text:  spectroscopy and chromatography. Scientists engaged in chemical research are known as chemists. Most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines.

R. Forman. In 1988, Warner/Chappell Music purchased the company owning the copyright for 25 million, with the value of \"\"Happy Birthday\"\" estimated at 5 million. Based on the 1935 copyright registration, Warner claimed that the United States copyright will not expire until 2030, and that unauthorized public performances of the song are illegal unless royalties are paid to Warner. In one specific instance in February 2010, the royalty for a single use was said to be 700.\n[2] Title: \"Happy Birthday to You\" Text:  Warner/Chappell Music acquired Birch Tree Group Limited in 1988 for 25 million. The company continued to insist that one cannot sing the \"\"Happy Birthday to You\"\" lyrics for profit without paying royalties: in 2008, Warner collected about 5,000 per day (2 million per year) in royalties for the song. Warner/Chappell claimed copyright for every use in film, television, radio, anywhere open to the public, and for any group where a substantial number of those in attendance are not family or friends of whoever is performing the song.\n[3] Title: \"Happy Birthday to You\" Text:  However, Warner/Chappell had failed to prove that it actually had ever held a copyright to the lyrics, so the court was able to grant summary judgment to the plaintiffs, thus resolving the case. Some initial news sources characterized the decision as ruling that the song was in the public domain, but the decision did not go so far, holding only that Warner/Chappell did not prove they owned the copyright. However, because there are no other claimants to the copyright, and the copyright to the melody long ago expired, the plaintiffs suggested that the song was \"\"de facto\"\" in the public domain.\n[4] Title: \"Happy Birthday to You\" Text:  The company also argued that it was not acting in bad faith in withholding the evidence of the 1927 publication. On September 22, 2015, federal judge George H. King ruled that the Warner/Chappell copyright claim over the lyrics was invalid. The 1935 copyright held by Warner/Chappell applied only to a specific piano arrangement of the song, not the lyrics or melody. The court held that the question of whether the 1922 and 1927 publications were authorized, thus placing the song in the public domain, presented questions of fact that would need to be resolved at trial.\n[5] Title: \"Happy Birthday to You\" Text:  American law professor Robert Brauneis, who extensively researched the song, concluded in 2010 that \"\"It is almost certainly no longer under copyright.\"\" In 2013, based in large part on Brauneis's research, Good Morning to You Productions, a company producing a documentary about \"\"Good Morning to All\"\", sued Warner/Chappell for falsely claiming copyright to the song. In September 2015, a federal judge declared that the Warner/Chappell copyright claim was invalid, ruling that the copyright registration applied only to a specific piano arrangement of the song, and not to its lyrics and melody.\nQuestion: who owns the rights to the song happy birthday\nYour answer: ",

For the song, Sting received the 1983 British Academy's Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. The song is considered to be both the Police's and Sting's signature song, and in 2010 was estimated to generate between a quarter and a third of Sting's music publishing income.\n[4] Title: \"Every Breath You Take\" Text:  It also ranked number 25 on \"\"Billboard\"\"s Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs. In 2015, the song was voted by the British public as the nation's favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV. Sting wrote the song in 1982 in the aftermath of his separation from Frances Tomelty and the beginning of his relationship with Trudie Styler. Their split was controversial. As \"\"The Independent\"\" reported in 2006, \"\"The problem was, he was already married \u2013 to actress Frances Tomelty, who just happened to be Trudie's best friend (Sting and Frances lived next door to Trudie in Bayswater, West London, for several years before the two of them became lovers).\n[5] Title: \"Every Breath You Take\" Text:  The affair was widely condemned.\"\" In order to escape from the public eye, Sting retreated in the Caribbean. He started writing the song at Ian Fleming's writing desk on the Goldeneye estate in Oracabessa, Jamaica. The lyrics are the words of a possessive lover who is watching \"\"every breath you take; every move you make\"\". Sting later said he was disconcerted by how many people think the song is more positive than it is. He insists it is about the obsession with a lost lover, and the jealousy and surveillance that follow.\nQuestion: who sang the song every breath you take\nYour answer: ",

The returned territory comprised Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula, which were respectively ceded to Britain in 1842 and 1860, as well as the New Territories, which were leased for 99 years from 1898.\n[2] Title: \"Handover of Hong Kong\" Text:  The Declaration entered into force with the exchange of instruments of ratification on 27 May 1985 and was registered by the People's Republic of China and United Kingdom governments at the United Nations on 12 June 1985. In the Joint Declaration, the People's Republic of China Government stated that it had decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong (including Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories) with effect from 1 July 1997 and the United Kingdom Government declared that it would restore Hong Kong to the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997.\n[3] Title: \"Sino-British Joint Declaration\" Text:  It entered into force with the exchange of instruments of ratification on 27 May 1985, and was registered by the PRC and UK governments at the United Nations on 12 June 1985.

The PRC Government also declared its basic policies regarding Hong Kong in the document.\n[4] Title: \"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Establishment Day\" Text:  Although Hong Kong Island and Kowloon had been ceded to the United Kingdom in perpetuity, the control on the New Territories was a 99-year lease.

The Declaration entered into force with the exchange of instruments of ratification on 27 May 1985. In the Joint Declaration, the PRC Government stated that it had decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong (including Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories) with effect from 1 July 1997, and the UK Government declared that it would restore Hong Kong to the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997.\n[5] Title: \"Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory\" Text:  This made it unfeasible to return the leased land alone as it would have split Hong Kong into two parts. The Chinese also started to pressure the British to return all of Hong Kong, taking the position that they would not accept so-called \"\"unequal treaties\"\" that were imposed on them by colonial powers. The governments of the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China (PRC) concluded the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, under which the sovereignty of the leased territories, together with Hong Kong Island and Kowloon (south of Boundary Street) ceded under the Treaty of Nanking (1842) and Convention of Peking (1860), was scheduled to be transferred to the PRC on 1 July 1997.\nQuestion: when did the british hand-over sovereignty of hong kong back to china\nYour answer: ",

With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth. The first form of life to develop on the Earth were microbes, and they remained the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear. Microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally microscopic, and smaller than the human eye can see. They include Bacteria, Fungi, Archaea, and Protista.

Although bacterial fossils exist, such as stromatolites, their lack of distinctive morphology prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution, or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species. However, gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial phylogeny, and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage.\n[5] Title: Life Text:  The earliest known life forms are microfossils of bacteria. 3.45 billion year old Australian rocks are reported to have contained microorganisms. In 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes thought to be present in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all living organisms, already a complex organism and not the first living thing. Since its primordial beginnings, life on Earth has changed its environment on a geologic time scale. To survive in most ecosystems, life must often adapt to a wide range of conditions.

To showcase his idea, a pilot episode was filmed in September 2005, with the judging panel consisting of Cowell, Fern Britton (at the time, presenter of \"\"This Morning\"\"), as well as tabloid journalist Piers Morgan. The pilot was not broadcast on television until it was shown as part of a documentary series entitled \"\"The Talent Show Story\"\" in January 2012.\n[2] Title: \"Britain's Got Talent\" Text:  Britain's Got Talent Britain's Got Talent (often abbreviated to BGT) is a televised British talent show competition, broadcast on ITV. It is a part of the global \"\"Got Talent\"\" franchise created by Simon Cowell, and is produced by both Thames (formerly Talkback Thames) and Syco Entertainment production, with its distribution handled by Fremantle. Since its premiere in June 2007, each series has been aired in late Spring/early Summer, and hosted by Ant & Dec. To accompany each series since it first began, a sister show is run on ITV2 entitled Britain's Got More Talent presented by Stephen Mulhern.\n[3] Title: \"Simon Cowell\" Text:  The show was a huge success for NBC, drawing around 12 million viewers a week, and beating \"\"So You Think You Can Dance\"\" on Fox (produced by rival and \"\"Idol\"\" creator Simon Fuller). \"\"Britain's Got Talent\"\" debuted on ITV in June 2007. Cowell appeared as a judge alongside Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan. The show was a ratings success and second and third seasons followed in 2008 and 2009. The third series featured a publicity coup when Susan Boyle made a global media impact comparable to that of any previous talent show series winner with her regional audition performance.\n[4] Title: \"Britain's Got Talent\" Text:  I can\u2019t be a hypocrite and come in and do this.

The My Pet Monster character began as a plush doll first produced by American Greetings in 1986. As one of the few plush dolls marketed to boys at the time, My Pet Monster was popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n[2] Title: \"My Pet Monster\" Text:  Capitalizing on the nostalgia in many children of the '80s, Toymax released a 22-inch tall talking My Pet Monster doll in 2001. The character's popularity spawned a live-action direct-to-video film in 1986 about a boy who becomes the Pet Monster after being exposed to a statue, changing when hungry. Dr Snyder, the scientist who originally discovered the statues and the legend behind them, wants to kidnap him for publicity purposes, while his sister helps her brother out of the crisis. My Pet Monster also spawned a children's cartoon series that ran for one season on ABC, produced by Ellipse (France), Nelvana (Canada), and Hi-Tops Video in association with Golden Books.\n[3] Title: \"My Pet Monster\" Text:  In the final episode, it is also shown that Beastur hates to be hugged, even more so than being exposed to light. Much of the voice cast of \"\"My Pet Monster\"\" returned 2 years later in 1989 for \"\"Beetlejuice\"\", another cartoon show with a surreal theme and a supernatural world populated by fantastic monsters.

The handcuffs could also be worn by children and came with a breakaway link so that the child could simulate breaking the chain. Several versions of the doll have been released in various sizes and other attributes. Other characters were also created with brightly colored fur and unorthodox names like Gwonk, Wogster and Rark. Their popularity allowed a wealth of merchandise including coloring books, Golden Look-Look books, frame-tray puzzles and various other items.\n[5] Title: Nelvana Text:  There were two shows from Nelvana based on the AmToy properties, \"\"Madballs\"\" and \"\"My Pet Monster\"\". Despite the successes of their earlier works, perhaps its greatest success at the time came in the form of the Care Bears, thanks to its acquisition of the character rights from American Greetings, the franchise owners.

Humperdinck's version, used in the end credits of the film and included on the soundtrack released on the Universal/Geffen Records label, was used as the B-side of Red Hot Chili Peppers's cover of the Ohio Players' \"\"Love Rollercoaster\"\", which was released as a single in its own right.\n[2] Title: \"Beavis and Butt-Head Do America\" Text:  Noticeably missing are \"\"Mucha Muchacha\"\", the version of \"\"Lesbian Seagull\"\" with Mr. Van Driessen singing, and the score tracks performed by The London Metropolitan Orchestra, which were released on a separate album. \"\"Two Cool Guys\"\", written and performed by soul/funk musician Isaac Hayes, is a semi-parody of Hayes' Academy Award-winning \"\"Theme from \"\"Shaft\"\"\"\". It incorporates the theme from the \"\"Beavis and Butt-head\"\" television series as a rhythm guitar line, and series creator Mike Judge, who wrote the theme, is given a co-writing credit with Hayes in the soundtrack liner notes.\n[3] Title: \"Isaac Hayes\" Text:  A companion album released around the same time, \"\"Raw and Refined,\"\" featured a collection of previously unreleased instrumentals, both old and new. Hayes worked on the theme for the 1996 theatrical release 'Beavis and Butt-Head Do America', producing a piece which was essentially a hybrid of 'The Theme From Shaft' and the theme from the original 'Beavis and Butt-Head' TV show. Soon after, Hayes joined the founding cast of Comedy Central's animated TV series, \"\"South Park.\"\" Hayes provided the voice for the character of \"\"Chef\"\", the amorous elementary-school lunchroom cook, from the show's debut on August 13, 1997 (one week shy of his 55th birthday), through the end of its ninth season in 2006.\n[4] Title: \"Theme from Shaft\" Text:  A 1998 Burger King marketing campaign featured Hayes singing a retooled version of the song, with lyrics now alluding to Mr. Potato Head, who is seen dancing on the piano that Hayes plays. Another Burger King commercial from 2002 promoted the Shaq Pack, where the lyrics alluded to Shaquille O'Neal. Hayes also parodied \"\"Theme from \"\"Shaft\"\"\"\" with \"\"Two Cool Guys\"\", the opening theme song for the film \"\"Beavis and Butt-head Do America\"\", in which Hayes adapts the \"\"Beavis and Butt-head\"\" television theme as a rhythm guitar line for a \"\"Shaft\"\"-esque song about the title characters.\n[5] Title: \"Beavis and Butt-Head Do America\" Text:  The opening credit sequence which the song features in is a take-off on popular 1970s cop movies and TV shows with Beavis and Butt-Head as hip ace sleuth Lothario detectives. The version of Ozzy Osbourne's \"\"Walk on Water\"\" is not the same version included in the film.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Water wheel\" Text:  The invention of the compartmentalized water wheel occurred in ancient Egypt around the 4th century BCE, in a rural context, away from the metropolis of Hellenistic Alexandria, and then spread to other parts of North Africa. According to John Peter Oleson, both the compartmented wheel and the hydraulic Noria appeared in Egypt by the 4th century BCE, with the Sakia being invented there a century later. This is supported by archeological finds at Faiyum, where the oldest archeological evidence of a water-wheel has been found, in the form of a Sakia dating back to the 3rd century BCE.\n[2] Title: \"Ancient Egyptian technology\" Text:  Recent scholarship suggests that the water wheel originates from Ptolemaic Egypt, where it appeared by the 3rd century BC. This is seen as an evolution of the paddle-driven water-lifting wheels that had been known in Egypt a century earlier. According to John Peter Oleson, both the compartmented wheel and the hydraulic Noria may have been invented in Egypt by the 4th century BC, with the Sakia being invented there a century later. This is supported by archeological finds at Faiyum, Egypt, where the oldest archeological evidence of a water-wheel has been found, in the form of a Sakia dating back to the 3rd century BC.\n[3] Title: \"Water wheel\" Text:  Unlike other water-lifting devices and pumps of the period though, the invention of the compartmented wheel cannot be traced to any particular Hellenistic engineer and may have been made in the late 4th century BC in a rural context away from the metropolis of Alexandria. The earliest depiction of a compartmented wheel is from a tomb painting in Ptolemaic Egypt which dates to the 2nd century BC. It shows a pair of yoked oxen driving the wheel via a sakia gear, which is here for the first time attested, too. The Greek sakia gear system is already shown fully developed to the point that \"\"modern Egyptian devices are virtually identical\"\".\n[4] Title: Noria Text:  This is supported by archeological finds at Faiyum, where the oldest archeological evidence of a water wheel has been found, in the form of a Sakia dating back to the 3rd century BCE. A papyrus dating to the 2nd century BCE also found in Faiyum mentions a water wheel used for irrigation, a 2nd-century BC fresco found at Alexandria depicts a compartmented Sakia, and the writings of Callixenus of Rhodes mention the use of a Sakia in Ptolemaic Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy IV in the late 3rd century BC. The undershot water wheel and overshot water wheel, both animal- and water-driven, and with either a compartmented body (Latin \"\"tympanum\"\") or a compartmented rim, were used by Hellenistic engineers between the 3rd and 2nd century BC.\n[5] Title: \"Water wheel\" Text:  A papyrus dating to the 2nd century BCE also found in Faiyum mentions a water wheel used for irrigation, a 2nd-century BC fresco found at Alexandria depicts a compartmented Sakia, and the writings of Callixenus of Rhodes mention the use of a Sakia in Ptolemaic Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy IV in the late 3rd century BC. Mediterranean engineers of the Hellenistic and Roman periods used the water wheel for both irrigation and as a power source. Its use in the Greco-Roman world dates back to the technically advanced and scientifically minded Hellenistic period between the 3rd and 1st centuries BCE.\nQuestion: when was the wheel first used in egypt\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Rule of 72\" Text:  For lower annual rates than those above, 69.3 would also be more accurate than 72. An early reference to the rule is in the \"\"Summa de arithmetica\"\" (Venice, 1494. Fol. 181, n. 44) of Luca Pacioli (1445\u20131514). He presents the rule in a discussion regarding the estimation of the doubling time of an investment, but does not derive or explain the rule, and it is thus assumed that the rule predates Pacioli by some time. Roughly translated: For higher rates, a bigger numerator would be better (e.g., for 20%, using 76 to get 3.8 years would be only about 0.002 off, where using 72 to get 3.6 would be about 0.2 off).\n[2] Title: \"Rule of 72\" Text:  The value 72 is a convenient choice of numerator, since it has many small divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12. It provides a good approximation for annual compounding, and for compounding at typical rates (from 6% to 10%). The approximations are less accurate at higher interest rates. For continuous compounding, 69 gives accurate results for any rate. This is because ln(2) is about 69.3%; see derivation below. Since daily compounding is close enough to continuous compounding, for most purposes 69, 69.3 or 70 are better than 72 for daily compounding.\n[3] Title: \"Rule of 72\" Text:  This shows that the rule of 72 is most precise for periodically composed interests around 8%. Alternatively, the E-M rule is obtained if the second-order Taylor approximation is used directly. For continuous compounding, the derivation is simpler and yields a more accurate rule: Rule\n[4] Title: \"Rule of 72\" Text:  This is because, as above, the rule of 72 is only an approximation that is accurate for interest rates from 6% to 10%. For every three percentage points away from 8% the value 72 could be adjusted by 1. or for the same result, but simpler: The Eckart\u2013McHale second-order rule (the E-M rule) provides a multiplicative correction for the rule of 69.3 that is very accurate for rates from 0% to 20%. The rule of 69.3 is normally only accurate at the lowest end of interest rates, from 0% to about 5%.\n[5] Title: \"Rule of 72\" Text:  As long as the product stays constant, the factors can be modified arbitrarily. The E-M rule could thus be written also as in order to keep the product mostly unchanged. In these variants, the multiplicative correction becomes 1 respectively for r=2 and r=8, the values for which the rule of 70 (respectively 72) is most precise. Similarly, the third-order Pad\u00e9 approximant gives a more accurate answer over an even larger range of \"\"r\"\", but it has a slightly more complicated formula: For periodic compounding, future value is given by: where formula_10 is the present value, formula_11 is the number of time periods, and formula_12 stands for the interest rate per time period.\nQuestion: where did the rule of 72 come from\nYour answer: ",

This first publication earned him $12. A revised version was published in the July 19, 1845 edition of the \"\"Broadway Journal\"\" under the now-standard title \"\"The Masque of the Red Death.\"\" The original title emphasized the figure at the end of the story; the new title puts emphasis on the masquerade ball.\n[2] Title: \"The Masque of the Red Death\" Text:  The Masque of the Red Death \"\"The Masque of the Red Death\"\", originally published as \"\"The Mask of the Red Death: A Fantasy\"\", is an 1842 short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe. The story follows Prince Prospero's attempts to avoid a dangerous plague, known as the Red Death, by hiding in his abbey. He, along with many other wealthy nobles, hosts a masquerade ball within seven rooms of the abbey, each decorated with a different color. In the midst of their revelry, a mysterious figure disguised as a Red Death victim enters and makes his way through each of the rooms.\n[3] Title: \"The Masque of the Red Death\" Text:  Prospero dies after confronting this stranger, whose \"\"costume\"\" proves to contain nothing tangible inside it; the guests also die in turn. Poe's story follows many traditions of Gothic fiction and is often analyzed as an allegory about the inevitability of death, though some critics advise against an allegorical reading. Many different interpretations have been presented, as well as attempts to identify the true nature of the titular disease. The story was first published in May 1842 in \"\"Graham's Magazine\"\" and has since been adapted in many different forms, including a 1964 film starring Vincent Price.\n[4] Title: \"The Masque of the Red Death (1964 film)\" Text:  The ball is transformed into a \"\"danse macabre\"\", changing from a maddening revelry to a grim ballet as the figure causes all of the nobles to die of the Red Death - while the corpses dance. Still believing the figure is Satan, Prospero asks for Francesca to be spared and given the same high status in Hell as he believes he himself will receive. The figure appears to consent to his request and sends Francesca outside, where he knows Gino is waiting. Before leaving, Francesca sadly kisses Prospero.\n[5] Title: \"The Masque of the Red Death (1964 film)\" Text:  It is the seventh of a series of eight Corman film adaptations largely based on Poe's works made by American International Pictures. On a mountain in medieval Italy, an old woman meets a mysterious red-cloaked figure, shuffling Tarot cards. The figure gives the woman a white rose, which then turns red and dappled with blood. Prince Prospero, a Satanist, visits the village over which he holds dominion, and is angrily confronted by two poor and starving villagers, Gino and Lodovico. Prospero sentences the pair to death, but Lodovico's daughter Francesca begs for their lives.\nQuestion: when was the masque of the red death written\nYour answer: ",

It was first performed on stage in 1964 by Cy Grant on the UK tour and by Gilbert Price in 1965 with the original Broadway cast. Nina Simone recorded \"\"Feeling Good\"\" for her 1965 album \"\"I Put a Spell on You\"\".\n[2] Title: \"Feeling Good\" Text:  It was described as a \"\"booming song of emancipation\"\", and a \"\"Billboard\"\" review said it was \"\"the kind of robust number that should have strong appeal.\"\" The original cast recording of the show, featuring Price's version of the song, was released by RCA Victor in early 1965, before the show reached New York. A version by Cy Grant with pianist Bill Le Sage \u2013 much jazzier than the original stage version \u2013 appeared on their 1965 album . Anthony Newley's own recording appeared on his 1965 album \"\"\"\"Who Can I Turn To\"\" and other songs from \"\"The Roar of the Greasepaint\"\"\"\".\n[3] Title: \"Feeling Good\" Text:  The show, directed by Newley, toured British provincial theatres, and was then taken to the US by theatre producer David Merrick. It opened on 16 May 1965 at the Shubert Theatre in New York City, where the role of \"\"the Negro\"\", who sings \"\"Feeling Good\"\", was taken by Gilbert Price. In the show, Price's character is asked to perform a game against the show's hero \"\"Cocky\"\"; but, as \"\"Cocky\"\" and his master \"\"Sir\"\" argue over the rules, \"\"the Negro\"\" reaches the centre of the stage and \"\"wins\"\", singing the song at his moment of triumph.\n[4] Title: \"Feeling Good\" Text:  The song has also been covered by Traffic, Michael Bubl\u00e9, John Coltrane, George Michael, Victory, Eels, Joe Bonamassa, EDEN, Muse, and Black Cat Bones, among others. Although Bricusse and Newley shared songwriting credits, the words of the song are usually attributed to Bricusse, with the music by Newley. The song was first performed in public by the Guyanese-British singer and actor Cy Grant on the opening night of \"\"The Roar of the Greasepaint \u2013 The Smell of the Crowd\"\" at the Theatre Royal in Nottingham on 3 August 1964; Elaine Paige played the part of one of the \"\"Urchins\"\" in the chorus.\n[5] Title: \"Hyper Music/Feeling Good\" Text:  \"\"Feeling Good\"\" was written by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley for the 1964 musical \"\"The Roar of the Greasepaint \u2013 The Smell of the Crowd,\"\" later covered by jazz and soul singer Nina Simone.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Horse meat\" Text:  Horse meat gained widespread acceptance in French cuisine during the later years of the Second French Empire. The high cost of living in Paris prevented many working-class citizens from buying meat such as pork or beef, so in 1866, the French government legalized the eating of horse meat, and the first butcher's shop specializing in horse meat opened in eastern Paris, providing quality meat at lower prices. During the Siege of Paris (1870\u20131871), horse meat, along with the meat from donkeys and mules, was eaten by anyone who could afford it, partly because of a shortage of fresh meat in the blockaded city, and also because horses were eating grain which was needed by the human populace.\n[2] Title: \"Horse meat\" Text:  Horse \"\"Leberk\u00e4se\"\" is available in special horse butcheries and occasionally at various stands, sold in a bread roll. Dumplings can also be prepared with horse meat, spinach, or Tyrolean \"\"Grauk\u00e4se\"\" (a sour milk cheese). They are occasionally eaten on their own, in a soup, or as a side dish. In Belgium, horse meat (\"\"paardenvlees\"\" in Dutch and \"\"viande chevaline\"\" in French) is popular in a number of preparations. Lean, smoked, and sliced horse meat fillet (\"\"paardenrookvlees\"\" or \"\"paardengerookt\"\"; \"\"filet chevalin\"\" in French) is served as a cold cut with sandwiches or as part of a cold salad.\n[3] Title: \"Horse meat\" Text:  Schep is typically served with fries, mayonnaise and a salad of raw Belgian endive. Horse meat is served in some restaurants in Bulgaria, as the preferred way of consuming it is in the form of steaks and burgers. Still being far from a meat for mass consumption, horse beef is re-gaining its popularity, which it had in the 60s and 70s of the past century, when it was also consumed in sausages and tartares. In France, specialized butcher shops (\"\"boucheries chevalines\"\") sell horse meat, as ordinary butcher shops were for a long time forbidden to deal in it.\n[4] Title: \"Horse meat\" Text:  French actress and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot has spent years crusading against the eating of horse meat. However, the opposition is far from unanimous; a 2007 readers' poll in the London magazine \"\"Time Out\"\" showed that 82% of respondents supported chef Gordon Ramsay's decision to serve horse meat in his restaurants. Horse meat has a slightly sweet taste reminiscent of a combination of beef and venison. Meat from younger horses tends to be lighter in color, while older horses produce richer color and flavor, as with most mammals.\n[5] Title: \"French cuisine\" Text:  Varieties of meat consumed include \"\"poulet\"\" (chicken), \"\"pigeon\"\" (squab), \"\"canard\"\" (duck), \"\"oie\"\" (goose, the source of foie gras), \"\"b\u0153uf\"\" (beef), \"\"veau\"\" (veal), \"\"porc\"\" (pork), \"\"agneau\"\" (lamb), \"\"mouton\"\" (mutton), \"\"caille\"\" (quail), \"\"cheval\"\" (horse), \"\"grenouille\"\" (frog), and \"\"escargot\"\" (snails).\nQuestion: how do you say horse meat in french\nYour answer: ",

In 1903 he went to practise as a barrister in South Africa, becoming the first black man to be called to the bar in the Cape Colony. Williams was born in 1869 in Arouca, Trinidad. His father Bishop Williams was a wheelwright from Barbados. His mother's name was Elizabeth. Williams attended the Arouca School, which at the time was run by a Chinese Trinidadian known as Stoney Smith. Williams started his working life at the age of 17, becoming a teacher with a Class III Certification, and in 1887 he was posted to the government school in San Fernando.\n[2] Title: \"Henry Sylvester-Williams\" Text:  The meeting of these minds resulted in the formation of the African Association. Stating that \"\"the time has come when the voice of Black men should be heard independently in their own affairs\"\", Williams gave his first address as honorary general secretary in the common-room at Gray's Inn, and Kinloch was the association's first treasurer. Some English people felt the Association would not last three months but by 1900 Williams was ready to hold the first Pan-African Conference (subsequent gatherings were known as Congresses). The three-day gathering took place at Westminster Town Hall on 23, 24, and 25 July with delegates comprising \"\"men and women of African blood and descent\"\" from West and South Africa, the West Indies, the United States and Liberia.\n[3] Title: Pan-Africanism Text:  The group addressed meetings and organised letter-writing campaigns, published campaigning material and visited parliament. They wrote to figures such as Granville Sharp, William Pitt and other members of the white abolition movement, as well as King George III and the Prince of Wales, the future George IV. Modern Pan-Africanism began around the start of the 20th century. The African Association, later renamed the Pan-African Association, was established around 1897 by Henry Sylvester-Williams, who organized the First Pan-African Conference in London in 1900. With the independence of Ghana in March 1957, Kwame Nkrumah was elected as the first Prime Minister and President of the State.\n[4] Title: \"Gold Coast Aborigines' Rights Protection Society\" Text:  The Gold Coast ARPS was particularly interested in the Pan-African Conference that took place in July 1900 in London, the first conference of its kind to occur. The influence of this conference on the members of the Gold Coast ARPS was a renewed belief that, eventually, the indigenous African peoples would be able to successfully rise up against the imperialist powers that had subjugated them for centuries and begin to govern themselves. This interest in pan-Africanism manifested itself in attempts by the Gold Coast ARPS to hold a similar conference on the Gold Coast, although the idea never came to fruition.\n[5] Title: \"Pan-African Congress\" Text:  Du Bois, Malawi's Hastings Banda, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, prominent Jamaican barrister Dudley Thompson and Obafemi Awolowo and Jaja Wachuku from Nigeria. It also led partially to the creation of the Pan-African Federation, founded in 1946 by Nkrumah and Kenyatta. There were 33 delegates from the West Indies and 35 from various British organizations, including the West African Students Union. The presence of 77-year-old Du Bois was historic, as he had organized the First Pan-African Congress in 1919. The British Press scarcely mentioned the conference. A number of resolutions were passed, among them the criminalization of racial discrimination and the main resolution decrying imperialism and capitalism.\nQuestion: where was the first pan african conference held\nYour answer: ",

Washington laid the cornerstone for the United States Capitol (then called the \"\"Congress House\"\") on September 18, 1793. John Adams, Washington's successor, moved into the White House in November 1800; that same month, Congress held its first session in the Capitol. The following February, Congress approved the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, which officially organized the District of Columbia, and, in accordance with the Constitution, named Congress as its exclusive governing authority.\n[2] Title: \"White House\" Text:  As part of a futile effort to have Philadelphia named the permanent national capital, Pennsylvania built a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away, but Washington declined to occupy it. President John Adams also occupied the Market Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On Saturday, November 1, 1800, he became the first president to occupy the White House. The President's House in Philadelphia became a hotel and was demolished in 1832, while the unused presidential mansion became home to the University of Pennsylvania. The President's House was a major feature of Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant's' plan for the newly established federal city, Washington, D.C. (see: L'Enfant Plan).\n[3] Title: \"White House\" Text:  Although the structure was not completed until some years after the presidency of George Washington, there is speculation that the name of the traditional residence of the President of the United States may have derived from Martha Washington's home, White House Plantation in Virginia, where the nation's first President had courted the First Lady in the mid-18th century. On Saturday, November 1, 1800, John Adams became the first president to take residence in the building. During Adams' second day in the house, he wrote a letter to his wife Abigail, containing a prayer for the house.\n[4] Title: \"White House\" Text:  In May 1790, New York began construction of Government House for his official residence, but he never occupied it. The national capital moved to Philadelphia in December 1790. The July 1790 Residence Act named Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the temporary national capital for a 10-year period while the Federal City was under construction. The City of Philadelphia rented Robert Morris's city house at 190 High Street (now 524\u201330 Market Street) for Washington's presidential residence. The first U.S. President occupied the Market Street mansion from November 1790 to March 1797 and altered it in ways that may have influenced the design of the White House.\n[5] Title: \"Court House Square (Charleston)\" Text:  President George Washington visited Charleston in May 1791, may have met with Hoban, and summoned the architect to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the temporary national capital) in June 1792. The following month, Hoban was named winner of the design competition for The White House in Washington, DC. The Courthouse itself is still in use, located in the historic district near the park at Washington Square.

After they formally teamed up in burlesque in 1936, he and Costello continued to hone the sketch. It was a big hit in 1937, when they performed the routine in a touring vaudeville revue called \"\"Hollywood Bandwagon\"\". In February 1938, Abbott and Costello joined the cast of \"\"The Kate Smith Hour\"\" radio program, and the sketch was first performed for a national radio audience on March 24 of that year.\n[2] Title: \"Abbott and Costello\" Text:  The sketch was based on other earlier burlesque wordplay routines. They began honing the routine shortly after teaming up in 1936, and performed it in vaudeville acts in 1937 and 1938. It was first heard by a national radio audience on March 24, 1938 when the team were regulars on the Kate Smith radio show. By then, John Grant had been writing or adapting other sketches for the team and may have helped expand \"\"Who's On First?\"\" prior to its radio debut. He stayed on as their head writer into the 1950s.\n[3] Title: \"Who's on First?\" Text:  Some versions continue with references to Enos Slaughter, which Costello misunderstands as \"\"He knows\"\" Slaughter. By 1944, Abbott and Costello had the routine copyrighted. Abbott and Costello performed \"\"Who's on First?\"\" numerous times in their careers, rarely performing it exactly the same way twice. They did the routine for President Franklin Roosevelt several times. An abridged version was featured in the team's 1940 film debut, \"\"One Night in the Tropics\"\". The duo reprised the bit in their 1945 film \"\"The Naughty Nineties\"\", and it is that longer version which is considered their finest recorded rendition.\n[4] Title: \"Abbott and Costello\" Text:  \"\"Who's on First?\"\" is believed to be available in as many as twenty versions, ranging from one minute to up to ten minutes. The team could time the routine at will, adding or deleting portions as needed for films, radio or television. The longest version is seen in \"\"The Actors' Home\"\" episode of their filmed TV series, running approximately eight minutes. A live performance commemorating the opening day of the Lou Costello Jr Youth Foundation in 1947 was recorded, and has been included in numerous comedy albums.\n[5] Title: \"Abbott and Costello\" Text:  Since Lou owned the series (with Abbott working on salary), this allowed them to own these versions of the classic routines as well. Although \"\"The Abbott and Costello Show\"\" originally ran for only two seasons, it found a larger viewership in reruns from the 1960s to the 1990s. The shows have also been released in three different DVD sets over the years. \"\"Who's on First?\"\" is Abbott and Costello's signature routine.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Leopard (pattern)\" Text:  Leopard (pattern) A leopard pattern is a spotted color pattern, particularly in the hair coat or skin of animals, but can also describe spotting patterns in plants and fabrics. The term refers to the black and gold spotted coat of the leopard cat, but is used to describe many color combinations that result in spots scattered randomly across the skin or hair coat of other animals. Examples of animals with coloring patterns termed \"\"leopard\"\" include many great cats in the genus \"\"Panthera\"\", the leopard frog, the \"\"leopard\"\" spotting pattern in the Appaloosa and Knabstrupper breeds of horses, the leopard seal, insects such as the giant leopard moth, and fish species such as the leopard darter, leopard shark, and the leopard eel.\n[2] Title: \"Leopard (pattern)\" Text:  Examples of plants that use the term include the leopard lily, and the leopard flower. The \"\"Lp\"\" (leopard complex) gene is responsible for the leopard color pattern in horses, which not only produces a spotted coat color but also causes mottling of the skin, a white sclera around the eye, and striped hooves. Horses with the \"\"Lp\"\" gene may be spotted all over, or may have concentrations of spots in various patterns. Leopard (pattern) A leopard pattern is a\n[3] Title: Appaloosa Text:  These patterns are described as follows: Any horse that shows Appaloosa core characteristics of coat pattern, mottled skin, striped hooves, and a visible white sclera, carries at least one allele of the dominant \"\"leopard complex\"\" (LP) gene. The use of the word \"\"complex\"\" is used to refer to the large group of visible patterns that may occur when LP is present. LP is an autosomal incomplete dominant mutation in the TRPM1 gene located at horse chromosome 1 (ECA 1). All horses with at least one copy of LP show leopard characteristics, and it is hypothesized that LP acts together with other patterning genes (PATN) that have not yet been identified to produce the different coat patterns.\n[4] Title: Knabstrupper Text:  Knabstrupper The Knabstrupper or Knabstrup is a Danish breed of horse with an unusual range of coat coloration. The breed is usually around , but also pony-sized ones (under are found. Coat patterns range from solid to a full leopard-spotted coat, with many variants in between. The spotted coat is caused by a genetic mechanism called the leopard complex. The spotted color patterns common in the Knabstrupper are seen in other breeds, such as the Appaloosa horse, though the two breeds developed independently of one another. The breed generally has either warmblood or Baroque horse conformation.\n[5] Title: Appaloosa Text:  Many current breeders also attempt to breed away from the sparse, \"\"rat tail\"\" trait, and therefore modern Appaloosas have fuller manes and tails. The coat color of an Appaloosa is a combination of a base color with an overlaid spotting pattern. The base colors recognized by the Appaloosa Horse Club include bay, black, chestnut, palomino, buckskin, cremello or perlino, roan, gray, dun and grulla. Appaloosa markings have several pattern variations. It is this unique group of spotting patterns, collectively called the \"\"leopard complex\"\", that most people associate with the Appaloosa horse.\nQuestion: what is the pattern on a leopard 's coat called\nYour answer: ",

Under the 1987 Constitution, the minimum requirements for appointment to the Supreme Court are natural born citizenship; 40 years of age; and 15 years or more as a judge of a lower court or engaged in the practice of law in the Philippines. (\"\"sec. 7(1), Article VIII\"\") The members of the Court are appointed by the President from a list of at least 3 nominees prepared by the Judicial and Bar Council.\n[3] Title: \"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines\" Text:  Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines An Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines is one of 15 members of the Philippine Supreme Court, the highest court in the Philippines. The Chief Justice presides over the High Court, but carries only 1 of the 15 votes in the court. Traditionally, the Chief Justice is deemed as \"\"primus inter pares\"\" (\"\"first among equals\"\") among the Justices. Until 1973, only men were appointed as Associate Justices to the Court.\n[4] Title: \"Supreme Court of the Philippines\" Text:  Its decisions could be further appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. From 1901 to 1935, although a Filipino was always appointed chief justice, the majority of the members of the Supreme Court were Americans. Complete Filipinization was achieved only with the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in 1935. Claro M. Recto and Jose P. Laurel were among the first appointees to replace the American justices. With the ratification of the 1935 Constitution in a plebiscite held on May 14, 1935, the membership in the Supreme Court increased to 11: a chief justice and ten associate justices, who sat \"\"en banc\"\" or in two divisions of five members each.\n[5] Title: \"Supreme Court of the Philippines\" Text:  The Supreme Court of the Philippines was officially established on June 11, 1901 through the passage of Act No. 136, otherwise known as the Judiciary Law of the Second Philippine Commission. By virtue of that law, judicial power in the Philippine Islands was vested in the Supreme Court, Courts of First Instance and Justice of the Peace courts. Other courts were subsequently established. The judicial structure introduced by Act No. 136 was reaffirmed by the US Congress with the passage of the Philippine Bill of 1902. The Administrative Code of 1917 ordained the Supreme Court as the highest tribunal of the Philippines with nine members: a chief justice and eight associate justices.\nQuestion: qualification of the members of the supreme court in the philippines\nYour answer: ",

The method of address translation defined and the protocol permit Fibre Channel storage devices and host adapters to be attached to an IP-based fabric using transparent gateways. The iFCP protocol layer's main function is to transport Fibre Channel frame images between Fibre Channel ports attached both locally and remotely. iFCP encapsulates and routes the fibre channel frames that make up each Fibre Channel information unit via a predetermined TCP connection for transport across the IP network when transporting frames to a remote Fibre Channel port.\n[2] Title: \"Internet Fibre Channel Protocol\" Text:  Internet Fibre Channel Protocol Internet Fibre Channel Protocol (iFCP) is a gateway-to-gateway network protocol standard that provides Fibre Channel fabric functionality to Fibre Channel devices over an IP network. It is officially ratified by the Internet Engineering Task Force. Its most common forms are in 1 Gbit/s, 2 Gbit/s, 4 Gbit/s, 8 Gbit/s, and 10 Gbit/s. The iFCP protocol enables the implementation of Fibre Channel functionality over an IP network, within which the Fibre Channel switching and routing infrastructure is replaced by IP components and technology. Congestion control, error detection and recovery are provided through the use of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).\n[3] Title: \"Internet Fibre Channel Protocol\" Text:  Internet Fibre Channel Protocol Internet Fibre Channel Protocol (iFCP) is a gateway-to-gateway network protocol standard that provides Fibre Channel fabric functionality to Fibre Channel devices over an IP network.

It governs a set of standards created in January 2006 for address resolution (ARP) and transmitting IPv4 and IPv6 network packets over a Fibre Channel (FC) network. IPFC makes up part of the FC-4 protocol-mapping layer of a Fibre Channel system. In IPFC, each IP datagram packet is wrapped into a FC frame, with its own header, and transmitted as a sequence of one or more frames. The receiver at the other end received the frames, strips the FC headers and reassembles the IP packet.\n[5] Title: \"Fibre Channel\" Text:  Most block storage runs over Fibre Channel Fabrics and supports many upper level protocols. Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) is a transport protocol that predominantly transports SCSI commands over Fibre Channel networks. Mainframe computers run the FICON command set over Fibre Channel because of its high reliability and throughput. Fibre Channel can be used to transport data from storage systems that use solid-state flash memory storage medium by transporting NVMe protocol commands. When the technology was originally devised, it ran over optical fiber cables only and, as such, was called \"\"Fiber Channel\"\".\nQuestion: which type of technology encapsulates fibre channel communications over tcp / ip\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt\" Text:  On the morning of December 7, 1941, the Japanese struck the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor with a surprise attack, knocking out the main American battleship fleet and killing 2,403 American servicemen and civilians. The great majority of scholars have rejected the conspiracy thesis that Roosevelt, or any other high government officials, knew in advance about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese had kept their secrets closely guarded, and while senior American officials were aware that war was imminent, they did not expect an attack on Pearl Harbor.\n[2] Title: \"Attack on Pearl Harbor\" Text:  In mid-1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved the Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Hawaii. He also ordered a military buildup in the Philippines, taking both actions in the hope of discouraging Japanese aggression in the Far East. Because the Japanese high command was (mistakenly) certain any attack on the United Kingdom's Southeast Asian colonies, including Singapore, would bring the U.S. into the war, a devastating preventive strike appeared to be the only way to prevent American naval interference. An invasion of the Philippines was also considered necessary by Japanese war planners.\n[3] Title: \"Attack on Pearl Harbor\" Text:  There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan, but the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, \"\"a date which will live in infamy\"\". Because the attack happened without a declaration of war and without explicit warning, the attack on Pearl Harbor was later judged in the Tokyo Trials to be a war crime. War between Japan and the United States had been a possibility that each nation had been aware of, and planned for, since the 1920s.\n[4] Title: \"Military history of the United States during World War II\" Text:  Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt officially pronounced 7 December 1941, as \"\"a date which will live in infamy\"\" and asked for a declaration of war on Japan before a joint session of Congress on 8 December 1941. The motion passed with only one vote against it, in both chambers. Just three days later, on 11 December 1941 Adolf Hitler declared war on the United States, and had already remarked on the evening of the date of the Japanese attack that \"\"We can't lose the war at all.\n[5] Title: \"Modern history\" Text:  [[File:Roosevelt Pearl Harbor.ogg|thumb|U.S President [[Franklin D.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Umbilical cord\" Text:  The blood flow through the umbilical cord is approximately 35 ml / min at 20 weeks, and 240 ml / min at 40 weeks of gestation. Adapted to the weight of the fetus, this corresponds to 115 ml / min / kg at 20 weeks and 64 ml / min / kg at 40 weeks. The umbilical cord enters the fetus via the abdomen, at the point which (after separation) will become the umbilicus (or navel). Within the fetus, the umbilical vein continues towards the transverse fissure of the liver, where it splits into two.\n[2] Title: \"Fetal circulation\" Text:  About half of this enters the fetal \"\"ductus venosus\"\" and is carried to the inferior vena cava, while the other half enters the liver proper from the inferior border of the liver. The branch of the umbilical vein that supplies the right lobe of the liver first joins with the portal vein. The blood then moves to the right atrium of the heart. In the fetus, there is an opening between the right and left atrium (the \"\"foramen ovale\"\"), and most of the blood flows from the right into the left atrium, thus bypassing pulmonary circulation.\n[3] Title: \"Fetal circulation\" Text:  The branch of the umbilical vein that supplies the right lobe of the liver first joins with the portal vein. The blood then moves to the right atrium of the heart. In the fetus, there is an opening between the right and left atrium (the \"\"foramen ovale\"\"), and most of the blood flows through this hole directly into the left atrium from the right atrium, thus bypassing pulmonary circulation. The continuation of this blood flow is into the left ventricle, and from there it is pumped through the aorta into the body.\n[4] Title: \"Umbilical vein\" Text:  Umbilical vein The umbilical vein is a vein present during fetal development that carries oxygenated blood from the placenta into the growing fetus. The umbilical vein provides convenient access to the central circulation of a neonate for restoration of blood volume and for administration of glucose and drugs. The blood pressure inside the umbilical vein is approximately 20 mmHg. The unpaired umbilical vein carries oxygen and nutrient rich blood derived from fetal-maternal blood exchange at the chorionic villi. More than two-thirds of fetal hepatic circulation is via the main portal vein, while the remainder is shunted from the left portal vein via the ductus venosus to the inferior vena cava, eventually being delivered to the fetal right atrium.\n[5] Title: \"Fetal circulation\" Text:  The fetal circulation of humans has been extensively studied by the health sciences. Much is known also of fetal circulation in other animals, especially livestock and model organisms such as mice, through the health sciences, veterinary science, and life sciences generally. Blood from the placenta is carried to the fetus by the umbilical vein. In humans, less than a third of this enters the fetal \"\"ductus venosus\"\" and is carried to the inferior vena cava, while the rest enters the liver proper from the inferior border of the liver.\nQuestion: where does the umbilical vein enter the circulation of the fetus\nYour answer: ",

Allen was driving with his Dutch girlfriend, Miriam Barendsen, when his Corvette swerved off the road on a sharp bend and went through a drystone wall. Despite the severity of the accident, Allen was committed to continuing his role as Def Leppard's drummer, and realised that he could use his legs to do some of the drumming work previously done with his arms.\n[2] Title: \"Hysteria (Def Leppard album)\" Text:  On 31 December 1984, Rick Allen lost his left arm when his Corvette flipped off a country road. Following the accident, the band stood by Allen's decision to return to the drum kit despite his disability, using a combination electronic/acoustic kit with a set of electronic pedals that triggered (via MIDI) the sounds that he would have played with his left arm. The band slowly continued production until Lange unexpectedly returned a year later, and Allen mastered his customised drum kit. However, the sessions were further delayed by Lange's own auto accident (sustaining leg injuries from which he quickly recovered) and a bout of the mumps suffered by singer Joe Elliott in 1986.\n[3] Title: \"Hysteria (Def Leppard album)\" Text:  The title of the album was thought up by drummer Rick Allen, referring to his 1984 auto accident and the ensuing worldwide media coverage surrounding it. It is also the last album to feature guitarist Steve Clark before his death, although songs co-written by him would appear on the band's next album, \"\"Adrenalize\"\". The album is the follow-up to the band's 1983 breakthrough \"\"Pyromania\"\". \"\"Hysteria\"\"s creation took over three years and was plagued by delays, including the aftermath of drummer Rick Allen\u2019s accident that cost him his left arm on New year\u2019s eve of 31 December, 1984.\n[4] Title: \"Rick Allen (drummer)\" Text:  In September 1979, they opened for Sammy Hagar at London's Hammersmith Odeon. Subsequently, Def Leppard played shows as a support act for AC/DC during October and November 1979. Allen celebrated his 16th birthday with a performance at the Hammersmith Odeon. On 14 March 1980, the band released their first album, \"\"On Through the Night\"\". Since their first album, Allen continues to record and tour with the band. On the afternoon of 31 December 1984, Allen was involved in a car accident with his then-girlfriend Miriam Barendsen on the A57 road in the countryside a few miles west of Sheffield.\n[5] Title: \"Rick Allen (drummer)\" Text:  Rick Allen (drummer) Richard John Cyril Allen (born 1 November 1963) is an English drummer who has played for the hard rock band Def Leppard since 1978.

On the right is a mosaic depicting the East Roman Emperor Justinian I, clad in Tyrian purple with a golden halo, standing next to court officials, Bishop Maximian, palatinae guards and deacons. The halo around his head gives him the same aspect as Christ in the dome of the apse, but is part of the tradition of rendering the imperial family with haloes describe by Ernst Kantorowicz in the King's Two Bodies. Justinian himself stands in the middle, with soldiers on his right and clergy on his left, emphasizing that Justinian is the leader of both church and state of his empire.\n[2] Title: \"Maximianus of Ravenna\" Text:  It was probably carved in Constantinople and shipped to Ravenna. It consists of decorative floral panels framing various figured panels, including one with the complex monogram of the bishop. In a famous 6th-century mosaic in San Vitale, Maximianus (named above the figure) is with Emperor Justinian and his retinue. The saint holds a jewelled cross and wears early versions of an alb, chasuble and pallium. He is regarded as a saint by both the Catholic and Orthodox churches, though essentially local to Ravenna, where there is a church dedicated to him at Piazza S. Massimiano, Punta Marina, Ravenna, 48020.\n[3] Title: \"Maximianus of Ravenna\" Text:  He completed the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, and also built Sant'Apollinare in Classe and several other churches. Maximianus devoted himself to the revision of liturgical books and to the emendation of the Latin text of the Bible, and commissioned a large number of illuminated manuscripts. For the high altar in Ravenna he had a hanging made of the most costly cloth, which was embroidered with a portrayal of the entire life of Jesus. In another hanging he had portraits of all his predecessors embroidered on gold ground. Maximian's most remarkable episcopal furnishing is the Throne of Maximian, the \"\"cathedra\"\" of the bishop which was constructed entirely of ivory panels.\n[4] Title: Mosaic Text:  She erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from Constantinople to Ravenna. The mosaics depicted the storm, portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of Ravenna, Peter Chrysologus. They are known only from Renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747. Ostrogoths kept alive the tradition in the 6th century, as the mosaics of the Arian Baptistry, Baptistry of Neon, Archbishop's Chapel, and the earlier phase mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale and Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo testify.\n[5] Title: \"Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe\" Text:  At the sides of the apse are two 7th century panels: the left one, which has been much restored, portrays the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IV granting privileges to an envoy of the Ravenna's archbishop. In the right panel are Abraham, Abel and Melchisedek around an altar, on which they offer a sacrifice to God. The choice of the subject is closely linked to the fight against Arianism, as it restates the both divine and human nature of Christ, the former negated by the Arians. In addition, the representation of Apollinaris among the apostles was a legitimation to Maximian as the first bishop of a diocese directly related to the early followers of Jesus, being Apollinaris, according to the legend, a disciple of St. Peter.\nQuestion: whose portrait appears on the choir call to the right of the apse of san vitale ravenna\nYour answer: ",

In the International System of Units (SI), the standard unit of area is the square metre (written as m), which is the area of a square whose sides are one metre long. A shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares. In mathematics, the unit square is defined to have area one, and the area of any other shape or surface is a dimensionless real number.\n[2] Title: \"MKS system of units\" Text:  MKS system of units The MKS system of units is a physical system of measurement that uses the metre, kilogram, and second (MKS) as base units. Adopted in 1889, use of the MKS system of units succeeded the centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units (CGS) in commerce and engineering. The metre and kilogram system served as the basis for the development of the International System of Units (abbreviated SI), which now serves as the international standard. Because of this, the standards of the CGS system were gradually replaced with metric standards incorporated from the MKS system.\n[3] Title: \"MKS system of units\" Text:  An advantage of MKS units is that since the derived units (like joules) are based on MKS units, using MKS units naturally gives answers in the appropriate SI unit. For example, the kinetic energy of an object is defined by . If the calculation is done in MKS units of kilogram and meters per second then the result is in joules, the SI unit for energy. If the same calculation is done using CGS units the answer is in ergs (). The exact list of units used in the MKS system changed over time.\n[4] Title: \"MKS system of units\" Text:  It incorporated base units other than the metre, kilogram, and second in addition to derived units. An incomplete list of the base and derived units appears below. Since the MKS system of units never had a governing body to rule on a standard definition, the list of units depended on different conventions at different times. In 1901, Giovanni Giorgi proposed to the (AEI) that this system, extended with a fourth unit to be taken from the units of electromagnetism, be used as an international system. This system was strongly promoted by electrical engineer George A. Campbell.\n[5] Title: \"International System of Units\" Text:  The fourth unit could be chosen to be electric current, voltage, or electrical resistance. Electric current with named unit 'ampere' was chosen as the base unit, and the other electrical quantities derived from it according to the laws of physics. This became the foundation of the MKS system of units. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a number of non-coherent units of measure based on the gram/kilogram, centimetre/metre and second, such as the \"\"Pferdest\u00e4rke\"\" (metric horsepower) for power, the darcy for permeability and \"\"millimetres of mercury\"\" for barometric and blood pressure were developed or propagated, some of which incorporated standard gravity in their definitions.\nQuestion: the unit of area in mks system is\nYour answer: ",

Every place that had 'the look' said, 'no thank you.'\"\"\n[4] Title: \"Animal House\" Text:  The film went on to become a classic, and Boyd was determined not to make the same mistake twice when the producers inquired about filming at Oregon. After consulting with student government leaders and officers of the Pan Hellenic Council, the Director of University Relations advised the president that the script, although raunchy and often tasteless, was a very funny spoof of college life. Boyd even allowed the filmmakers to use his office as Dean Wormer's. The actual house depicted as the Delta House was originally a residence in Eugene, the Dr. A.W.\n[5] Title: \"Animal House\" Text:  The film was also selected by \"\"The New York Times\"\" as one of \"\"The 1000 Best Movies Ever Made\"\". Animal House National Lampoon's Animal House is a 1978 American comedy film directed by John Landis and written by Harold Ramis, Douglas Kenney and Chris Miller. It stars John Belushi, Tim Matheson, John Vernon, Verna Bloom, Thomas Hulce, Stephen Furst, and Donald Sutherland.

Before an invasion became necessary, U.S. ambassadors learned that Spain had ceded Louisiana to France via the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso, and France offered to sell the territory to the U.S. Robert R. Livingston and James Monroe, U.S. ministers to France, agreed to the purchase, even though they had not been given the authority to do so. Jefferson was pleased with the purchase, but feared he had no constitutional authority to effect it. In an August 12, 1803 letter to Breckinridge, Jefferson discussed his constitutional misgivings about the Louisiana Purchase and proposed that Breckinridge introduce a simple constitutional amendment in the Senate: \"\"Louisiana, as ceded by France to the U.S., is made a part of the U.S.\"\" Breckinridge ignored the proposed amendment and immediately formed a coalition of western senators to approve the purchase.\n[2] Title: \"Louisiana Purchase\" Text:  Jefferson's Secretary of State, James Madison (the \"\"Father of the Constitution\"\"), assured Jefferson that the Louisiana Purchase was well within even the strictest interpretation of the Constitution. Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin added that since the power to negotiate treaties was specifically granted to the president, the only way extending the country's territory by treaty could \"\"not\"\" be a presidential power would be if it were specifically excluded by the Constitution (which it was not). Jefferson, as a strict constructionist, was right to be concerned about staying within the bounds of the Constitution, but felt the power of these arguments and was willing to \"\"acquiesce with satisfaction\"\" if the Congress approved the treaty.\n[3] Title: \"The Constitution is not a suicide pact\" Text:  The phrase also appears in the same context in \"\"Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez\"\", a 1963 U.S. Supreme Court decision written by Justice Arthur Goldberg. Thomas Jefferson offered one of the earliest formulations of the sentiment, although not of the phrase. In 1803, Jefferson's ambassadors to France arranged the purchase of the Louisiana territory in conflict with Jefferson's personal belief that the Constitution did not bestow upon the federal government the right to acquire or possess foreign territory. Due to political considerations, however, Jefferson disregarded his constitutional doubts, signed the proposed treaty, and sent it to the Senate for ratification.\n[4] Title: \"Louisiana Purchase\" Text:  The Americans originally sought to purchase only the port city of New Orleans and its adjacent coastal lands, but quickly accepted the bargain. The Louisiana Purchase occurred during the term of the third President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson. Before the purchase was finalized, the decision faced Federalist Party opposition; they argued that it was unconstitutional to acquire any territory. Jefferson agreed that the U.S. Constitution did not contain explicit provisions for acquiring territory, but he asserted that his constitutional power to negotiate treaties was sufficient. Throughout the second half of the 18th century, Louisiana was a pawn on the chessboard of European politics.\n[5] Title: \"James Monroe\" Text:  In agreeing to the purchase, Monroe violated his instructions, which had only allowed $9 million for the purchase of New Orleans and West Florida. The French did not acknowledge that West Florida remained in Spanish possession, and the United States would claim that France had sold West Florida to the United States for several years to come. Though he had not ordered the purchase of the entire territory, Jefferson strongly supported Monroe's actions, which ensured that the United States would continue to expand to the West. Overcoming doubts about whether the Constitution authorized the purchase of foreign territory, Jefferson won congressional approval for the Louisiana Purchase, and the acquisition doubled the size of the United States.\nQuestion: who owned the louisiana territory when the constitution was signed\nYour answer: ",

To date, this is the last championship in any of the four major sports to be won in Pittsburgh by the home team, as the Pirates' two subsequent World Series championships were clinched in Baltimore, while the Pittsburgh Penguins have won all five of their Stanley Cup championships on the road and the Pittsburgh Steelers have won all of their Super Bowl championships at neutral sites.\n[2] Title: \"Pittsburgh Pirates\" Text:  They again won the NL in 1925 and 1927 and the World Series in 1925. After a slow period, they returned to dominance and won the 1960 World Series, 1971 World Series and 1979 World Series. They won Eastern Division titles from 1990\u20131992 but did not return to the post-season after that until 2013. In 2013 the Pirates became the seventh MLB team to reach 10,000 all-time wins. On Opening Day 2015 the Pirates' loss to the Cincinnati Reds represented the team's 10,000th loss, making the Pirates the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, following the Philadelphia Phillies, Atlanta Braves, and Chicago Cubs.\n[3] Title: \"1960 World Series\" Text:  As noted in the superstition called the \"\"Ex-Cub Factor\"\", this was the only Series after 1945 and until 2001 in which a team with three or more former members of the Chicago Cubs (Don Hoak, Smoky Burgess, and Gene Baker) was able to win a World Series. The World Championship for the Pirates was their third overall and first since 1925. The Yankees, winners of their 10th pennant in 12 years, outscored the Pirates 55\u201327 in this Series, outhit them 91\u201360, outbatted them .338 to .256, hit 10 home runs to Pittsburgh's four (three of which came in Game 7), got two complete-game shutouts from Whitey Ford\u2014and lost.\n[4] Title: \"1960 World Series\" Text:  1960 World Series The 1960 World Series was played between the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League (NL) and the New York Yankees of the American League (AL) from October 5 to 13, 1960. It is most notable for the Game 7, ninth-inning home run hit by Bill Mazeroski, the only time a winner-take-all World Series game has ended with a walk-off home run. Despite losing the series, the Yankees scored 55 runs, the most runs scored by any one team in World Series history, a unique record, and more than twice as many as the Pirates, who scored 27 runs.\n[5] Title: \"1960 World Series\" Text:  The high chopper allowed Virdon to score, cutting the Yankee lead to 7\u20136. Hal Smith followed with a three-run home run to give the Pirates a 9\u20137 lead. Ralph Terry relieved Coates and got the last out. Bob Friend, an 18-game winner for the Pirates and their starter (and loser) in Games 2 and 6, came on in the ninth to try to protect the lead.

A live-action version of Belle appears as a main character in the ABC television series \"\"Once Upon a Time\"\", where she serves as the love interest of Rumplestiltskin (who is the show's version of the Beast). She is portrayed by Australian actress Emilie de Ravin. Another live-action version of the character appeared in the 2015 television film \"\"Descendants\"\", where she was played by Keegan Connor Tracy and serves as the Queen of the United States of Auradon.\n[2] Title: \"Belle (Beauty and the Beast)\" Text:  Belle (Beauty and the Beast) Belle is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Pictures' animated feature film \"\"Beauty and the Beast\"\" (1991). Originally voiced by American actress and singer Paige O'Hara, Belle is the non-conforming daughter of an inventor who yearns to abandon her predictable village life in return for adventure. When her father Maurice is imprisoned by a cold-hearted beast, Belle offers him her own freedom in exchange for her father's, and eventually learns to love the Beast despite his unsightly outward appearance.\n[3] Title: \"Paige O'Hara\" Text:  For her work as Belle, O'Hara was honored with a Disney Legend Award on August 19, 2011. As of 2011, O'Hara was replaced by Julie Nathanson as the voice of Belle due to her voice changing significantly over the course of twenty years. Despite this, she still paints Belle for Disney Fine Art and also continues to do promotional appearances for Disney. In 2016, O'Hara appeared at numerous special screenings of \"\"Beauty and the Beast\"\" in honor of the film's 25th anniversary. O'Hara reprised the role of Belle in the 2018 film \"\"Ralph Breaks the Internet\"\".\n[4] Title: \"Belle (Beauty and the Beast)\" Text:  Additionally, O'Hara was hired by Disney to perform the song \"\"Belle\"\" at the 64th Academy Awards in 1992.

The war ended in 1783 with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a European power. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.\n[5] Title: \"American Revolution\" Text:  American Revolution The American Revolution was a colonial revolt that took place between 1765 and 1783.

Sadly for the Falcons, they were eliminated from playoff contention for the third straight year after the Minnesota Vikings defeated the New York Giants later that day. They finished the regular season with a 20-17 loss at home to archrival New Orleans, giving them a final record of 8-8. The 2016 season was the Falcons 25th and final season at the Georgia Dome. They finished with an 11-5 record, earning them a first-round bye in the playoffs. After defeating the Seattle Seahawks in the Divisional Round and blowing out the Green Bay Packers in the title game, the Falcons advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time in 18 years, but lost to a New England Patriots team led by Tom Brady.\n[4] Title: \"Atlanta Falcons\" Text:  In their last regular season game at the Georgia Dome, the Falcons defeated the New Orleans Saints, and secured an 11\u20135 record and a first round bye. In the divisional round of the playoffs, Atlanta defeated the Seahawks 36\u201320 in the Georgia Dome, and hosted their last game at the Dome against the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game on January 22, 2017. The Falcons defeated the Packers 44\u201321 to advance to Super Bowl LI as the NFC champions. Atlanta was up 28\u20133 late in the third quarter, and the New England Patriots scored 31 unanswered points, with the last 6 in the first-ever overtime in the Super Bowl.\n[5] Title: \"Georgia Dome\" Text:  The stadium also hosted Super Bowl XXVIII in 1994 and Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000, the final NFL Game at the Georgia Dome was the 2016 NFC Championship between the Falcons and the Green Bay Packers, The Falcons won that game 44-21.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Administrative distance\" Text:  On Cisco routers, routes issued by OSPF have a lower default administrative distance than routes issued by the Routing Information Protocol. By default, OSPF has a default administrative distance of 110 and RIP has a default administrative distance of 120. The administrative distance (AD) value is assigned by the router on a per-protocol basis. Routers, by design, should not install multiple routes into the routing table as this has the potential to cause routing loops. While a router may run multiple routing protocols on the same device, it is necessary for the router to implement a process to ensure that multiple routes, pointing to the same destination do not simultaneously exist in the routing table.\n[2] Title: \"Administrative distance\" Text:  The router prefers protocols that have a lower assigned administrative distance. For example, OSPF has a default distance of 110, so it is preferred by the router process, over RIP, which has a default distance of 120. The administrator can arbitrarily reconfigure the administrative distances, which affects the ranking of the preferred routes by the routing process. On Cisco routers, static routes have an administrative distance of 1, making them preferred over routes issued by a dynamic routing protocol. The administrative distance is a value that is always only referenced by the local router itself.\n[3] Title: \"Administrative distance\" Text:  The administrative distance is not advertised on the network. The following table lists the default administrative distances for various routing protocols used on Cisco routers. The network administrator may modify the administrative distance to change the desired ranking of router protocols. This may be necessary in cases where routing redistribution has to be used, otherwise, routing loops could occur. The Cisco Internetwork Operating System enables network administrators to modify the distance by changing the distance value in sub-router configuration mode. In the example below, RIP's administrative distance is changed to 89 so that it used in preference to OSPF.\n[4] Title: \"Administrative distance\" Text:  Administrative distance Administrative distance (AD) or route preference is a number of arbitrary unit assigned to dynamic routes, static routes and directly-connected routes. The value is used by vendor-specific routers to rank routes from most preferred (low administrative distance value) to least preferred (high administrative distance value). When multiple paths to the same destination are available in its routing table, the router uses the route with the lowest administrative distance. Router vendors typically design their routers to assign a default administrative distance to each kind of route that is used, however, this value can usually be adjusted manually by a network administrator.\n[5] Title: \"Administrative distance\" Text:  codice_3 The \"\"do show ip route\"\" command will display the following, confirming that a static route has an administrative distance of 1. codice_4 Administrative distance Administrative distance (AD) or route preference is a number of arbitrary unit assigned to dynamic routes, static routes and directly-connected routes.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Frequency Text:  Other species have different hearing ranges. For example, some dog breeds can perceive vibrations up to 60,000 Hz. In many media, such as air, the speed of sound is approximately independent of frequency, so the wavelength of the sound waves (distance between repetitions) is approximately inversely proportional to frequency. In Europe, Africa, Australia, Southern South America, most of Asia, and Russia, the frequency of the alternating current in household electrical outlets is 50 Hz (close to the tone G), whereas in North America and Northern South America, the frequency of the alternating current in household electrical outlets is 60 Hz (between the tones B\u266d and B; that is, a minor third above the European frequency).\n[2] Title: \"Utility frequency\" Text:  Utility frequency The utility frequency, (power) line frequency (American English) or mains frequency (British English) is the nominal frequency of the oscillations of alternating current (AC) in an electric power grid transmitted from a power station to the end-user. In large parts of the world this is 50 Hz, although in the Americas and parts of Asia it is typically 60 Hz. Current usage by country or region is given in the list of mains power around the world. During the development of commercial electric power systems in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many different frequencies (and voltages) had been used.\n[3] Title: \"Mains electricity\" Text:  In North America, the most common combination is 120 V and a frequency of 60 Hz. Other voltages exist, and some countries may have, for example, 230 V but 60 Hz. This is a concern to travellers, since portable appliances designed for one voltage and frequency combination may not operate with, or may even be destroyed by another. The use of different and incompatible plugs and sockets in different regions and countries provides some protection from accidental use of appliances with incompatible voltage and frequency requirements. In the US, mains electric power is referred to by several names including \"\"household power\"\", \"\"household electricity\"\", \"\"house current\"\", \"\"powerline\"\", \"\"domestic power\"\", \"\"wall power\"\", \"\"line power\"\", \"\"AC power\"\", \"\"city power\"\", \"\"street power\"\".\n[4] Title: \"Electric power conversion\" Text:  In North America and northern South America it is usually 120 volt, 60 hertz (Hz), but in Europe, Asia, Africa and many other parts of the world, it is usually 230 volt, 50 Hz. Aircraft often use 400 Hz power internally, so 50 Hz or 60 Hz to 400 Hz frequency conversion is needed for use in the ground power unit used to power the airplane while it is on the ground. Conversely, internal 400 Hz internal power may be converted to 50 Hz or 60 Hz for convenience power outlets available to passengers during flight.\n[5] Title: \"Alternating current\" Text:  16.7 Hz power (formerly 16 2/3 Hz) is still used in some European rail systems, such as in Austria, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Off-shore, military, textile industry, marine, aircraft, and spacecraft applications sometimes use 400 Hz, for benefits of reduced weight of apparatus or higher motor speeds. Computer mainframe systems were often powered by 400 Hz or 415 Hz for benefits of ripple reduction while using smaller internal AC to DC conversion units. In any case, the input to the M-G set is the local customary voltage and frequency, variously 200 V (Japan), 208 V, 240 V (North America), 380 V, 400 V or 415 V (Europe), and variously 50 Hz or 60 Hz.\nQuestion: what is the frequency of ac current in north america\nYour answer: ",

Zebra mussels, the first dreissenid mussel introduced in North America, rapidly spread throughout many major river systems and the Great Lakes, causing substantial ecological and environmental impacts. The quagga mussel was first observed in North America in September 1989 when it was discovered in Lake Erie near Port Colborne, Ontario. It was not identified as a distinct species until 1991. The introduction of both dreissenid species into the Great Lakes appears to be the result of ballast water discharge from transoceanic ships that were carrying veligers, juveniles, or adult mussels.\n[2] Title: \"Lake Simcoe\" Text:  Phosphorus emissions from both urban and rural sources have upset the lake's ecosystem and fostered excessive aquatic plant growth, raising water temperatures, and decreasing oxygen levels, thereby rendering limited breeding grounds inhospitable. Lake Simcoe has been victim to zebra mussel, purple loosestrife, black crappie, spiny water flea, round goby, rusty crayfish and Eurasian milfoil invasions. The zebra mussel, which arrived in North American waters in 1985, originated in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea area and is thought to have been brought to North America in the ballast of foreign freighters.\n[3] Title: \"Great Lakes\" Text:  According to the Inland Seas Education Association, on average a new species enters the Great Lakes every eight months. Introductions into the Great Lakes include the zebra mussel, which was first discovered in 1988, and quagga mussel in 1989. The mollusks are efficient filter feeders, competing with native mussels and reducing available food and spawning grounds for fish. In addition, the mussels may be a nuisance to industries by clogging pipes. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that the economic impact of the zebra mussel could be about $5 billion over the next decade.\n[4] Title: \"Zebra mussel\" Text:  See the March 2016 USGS Zebra mussel distribution map for full scope of invasion. Congressional researchers have estimated that the zebra mussel has cost businesses and communities over $5 billion since their initial invasion.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Method acting\" Text:  Method acting Method acting is a range of training and rehearsal techniques that seek to encourage sincere and emotionally expressive performances, as formulated by a number of different theatre practitioners. These techniques are built on Stanislavski's system, developed by the Russian actor and director Konstantin Stanislavski and captured in his books \"\"An Actor Prepares\"\", \"\"Building a Character\"\", and \"\"Creating a Role\"\". Among those who have contributed to the development of the Method, three teachers are associated with \"\"having set the standard of its success\"\", each emphasizing different aspects of the approach: Lee Strasberg (the psychological aspects), Stella Adler (the sociological aspects), and Sanford Meisner (the behavioral aspects).\n[2] Title: \"Stanislavski's system\" Text:  Among the actors trained in the Meisner technique are Robert Duvall, Tom Cruise, Diane Keaton and Sydney Pollack. Though many others have contributed to the development of method acting, Strasberg, Adler, and Meisner are associated with \"\"having set the standard of its success\"\", though each emphasised different aspects: Strasberg developed the psychological aspects, Adler, the sociological, and Meisner, the behavioral. While each strand of the American tradition vigorously sought to distinguish itself from the others, they all share a basic set of assumptions that allows them to be grouped together.\n[3] Title: \"Leonard Nimoy\" Text:  He became a devotee of method acting concepts derived from the teachings of Konstantin Stanislavsky, realizing that the stage allowed him to explore the \"\"psychological, emotional, and physical territories of life that can't be done anywhere else,\"\" inquiries which he said led him into acting in the first place. He took method actor Marlon Brando as a role model, and like him, wore jeans and T-shirt. Between studies, to have some income, he took a job at an ice cream parlor on the Sunset Strip.\n[4] Title: \"William Gillette\" Text:  Patent No. 389,294 was applied for on June 9 and issued to him on September 11, entitled \"\"Method of Producing Stage Effects\"\". It was a method, not a mechanical device, so there were no illustrations in the two-page document. And the patent was very broad, introducing \"\"a new and useful method of imitating the sound of a horse or horses approaching, departing, or passing at a gallop, trot, or any other desired gait, the same to be used in producing stage effects in theatrical or other performances or entertainments, exhibitions, &c.\"\" His method consisted in \"\"beating with clappers, that represent the hoofs of a horse, upon some material that serves to represent the road-bed over which the horse is supposed to be traveling\"\" as well as \"\"stamping, pawing, or jumping about in a restive manner while the rider is mounting, and then starting off, first at a trot, then a gallop, and finally a run, or at any gait desired, in any order\"\".\n[5] Title: Psychodrama Text:  Psychodrama Psychodrama is an action method, often used as a psychotherapy, in which clients use spontaneous dramatization, role playing, and dramatic self-presentation to investigate and gain insight into their lives. Developed by Jacob L. Moreno, psychodrama includes elements of theater, often conducted on a stage, or a space that serves as a stage area, where props can be used. A psychodrama therapy group, under the direction of a licensed psychodramatist, reenacts real-life, past situations (or inner mental processes), acting them out in present time.\nQuestion: who developed a method of acting to reproduce real human behavior on the stage\nYour answer: ",

The mid-1930s saw the introduction of Kodachrome and Agfacolor Neu, the first easy-to-use color films of the modern multi-layer chromogenic type. These early processes produced transparencies for use in slide projectors and viewing devices, but color prints became increasingly popular after the introduction of chromogenic color print paper in the 1940s. The needs of the motion picture industry generated a number of special processes and systems, perhaps the best-known being the now-obsolete three-strip Technicolor process.\n[2] Title: \"Color photography\" Text:  In fact, some chemical magic was under development which would make that possible. In 1935, American Eastman Kodak introduced the first modern \"\"integral tripack\"\" color film and called it Kodachrome, a name recycled from an earlier and completely different two-color process. Its development was led by the improbable team of Leopold Mannes and Leopold Godowsky, Jr. (nicknamed \"\"Man\"\" and \"\"God\"\"), two highly regarded classical musicians who had started tinkering with color photographic processes and ended up working with the Kodak Research Laboratories.\n[3] Title: \"History of photography\" Text:  A new era in color photography began with the introduction of Kodachrome film, available for 16 mm home movies in 1935 and 35 mm slides in 1936. It captured the red, green, and blue color components in three layers of emulsion. A complex processing operation produced complementary cyan, magenta, and yellow dye images in those layers, resulting in a subtractive color image. Maxwell's method of taking three separate filtered black-and-white photographs continued to serve special purposes into the 1950s and beyond, and Polachrome, an \"\"instant\"\" slide film that used the Autochrome's additive principle, was available until 2003, but the few color print and slide films still being made in 2015 all use the multilayer emulsion approach pioneered by Kodachrome.\n[4] Title: \"Color print film\" Text:  Remember to never wash photographs until the gelatin layer is dry and stables. Furthermore, never attempt chemical treatments on color photographs because they can get distorted and destroy the image as a whole. Color print film Color prints have been developed since their beginnings in 1935 with Eastman Kodak\u2019s Company\u2019s Kodachrome film, as well in 1936 with Agfa Company\u2019s Agfacolor film. Color print film is the most common type of photographic film in consumer use. Print film produces a negative image when it is developed, requiring it to be reversed again when it is printed onto photographic paper.\n[5] Title: Photograph Text:  Before recent advances in digital photography, transparencies were widely used by professionals because of their sharpness and accuracy of color rendition. Most photographs published in magazines were taken on color transparency film. Originally, all photographs were monochromatic or hand-painted in color. Although methods for developing color photos were available as early as 1861, they did not become widely available until the 1940s or 1950s, and even so, until the 1960s most photographs were taken in black and white. Since then, color photography has dominated popular photography, although black and white is still used, being easier to develop than color.\nQuestion: when did they come out with color photos\nYour answer: ",

Its discussion also includes the way objects are made and their purely visual aspects. In painting, formalism emphasizes compositional elements such as color, line, shape, texture, and other perceptual aspects rather than the historical and social context. At its extreme, formalism in art history posits that everything necessary to comprehending a work of art is contained within the work of art. The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, that is, its conceptual aspect is considered to be of secondary importance.\n[2] Title: \"Formalism (art)\" Text:  This means they describe things very carefully.

Formalism (art) In art history, formalism is the study of art by analyzing and comparing form and style. Its discussion also includes the way objects are made and their purely visual aspects. In painting, formalism emphasizes compositional elements such as color, line, shape, texture, and other perceptual aspects rather than the historical and social context.\n[3] Title: \"Formalism (art)\" Text:  The artwork is defined by her as deep form: \"\"a form steeped in content that cannot be extracted from it. Artistic content, since it has no existence or sense apart from the form, cannot actually be referred to, other than speculatively. The content seals the form in an opaque, non-reflective, productive symbol.\"\" Here she introduces a broad concept of symbol, an opaque-productive symbol: one that is not transparent to preconceived or pre-determined referents and meanings, but rather produces new ones. A formal analysis is an academic method in art history and criticism for analyzing works of art: \"\"In order to perceive style, and understand it, art historians use 'formal analysis'.\n[4] Title: \"Formalism (art)\" Text:  The philosopher Donald Crawford has summarized Kant's position stating: \"\"Thus, for Kant, form consists of the spatial... organization of elements: figure, shape, or delineation...

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Retirement Text:  In most countries, the idea of retirement is of recent origin, being introduced during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Previously, low life expectancy and the absence of pension arrangements meant that most workers continued to work until death. Germany was the first country to introduce retirement benefits in 1889. Nowadays, most developed countries have systems to provide pensions on retirement in old age, which may be sponsored by employers or the state. In many poorer countries, support for the old is still mainly provided through the family.\n[2] Title: \"United States labor law\" Text:  In the early 20th century, the possibility of having a \"\"retirement\"\" became real as people lived longer, and believed the elderly should not have to work or rely on charity until they died. The law maintains an income in retirement in three ways (1) through public social security created by the Social Security Act of 1935, (2) occupational pensions managed through the employment relationship, and (3) private pensions or life insurance that individuals buy themselves. At work, most occupational pension schemes originally resulted from collective bargaining during the 1920s and 1930s.\n[3] Title: Retirement Text:  Countries began to adopt government policies on retirement during the late 19th century and the 20th century, beginning in Germany under Otto von Bismarck. A person may retire at whatever age they please. However, a country's tax laws or state old-age pension rules usually mean that in a given country a certain age is thought of as the \"\"standard\"\" retirement age. The \"\"standard\"\" retirement age varies from country to country but it is generally between 50 and 70 (according to latest statistics, 2011).\n[4] Title: Retirement Text:  Today, retirement with a pension is considered a right of the worker in many societies, and hard ideological, social, cultural and political battles have been fought over whether this is a right. In many western countries this right is mentioned in national constitutions. Retirement, or the practice of leaving one's job or ceasing to work after reaching a certain age, has been around since around the 18th century. Prior to the 18th century, humans had an average life expectancy between 26 and 40 years. In consequence, only a small percentage of the population reached an age where physical impairments began to be obstacles to working.\n[5] Title: Retirement Text:  Retirement is generally considered to be \"\"early\"\" it occurs before the age (or tenure) needed for eligibility for support and funds from government or employer-provided sources. Early retirees typically rely on their own savings and investments to be self-supporting, either indefinitely or until they begin receiving external support. Early retirement can also be used as a euphemistic term for being terminated from employment before typical retirement age. While conventional wisdom has it that one can retire and take 7% or more out of a portfolio year after year, this strategy would not have worked very often in the past.\nQuestion: where did the idea of retirement come from\nYour answer: ",

The 15-inch models were released with the same Intel Haswell processors and Iris Pro graphics as the 2014 models due to a delay in shipment of newer Broadwell quad-core processors. Apple continued to sell the 2015 15-inch model until July 2018. The Retina Display MacBook Pro largely follows the design of the previous generation with its aluminum enclosure and separated black keys.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Patellar reflex\" Text:  Patellar reflex The patellar reflex or knee-jerk (myotatic) (monosynaptic) (American spelling knee reflex) is a stretch reflex which tests the L2, L3, and L4 segments of the spinal cord. Striking the patellar tendon with a reflex hammer just below the patella stretches the muscle spindle in the quadriceps muscle. This produces a signal which travels back to the spinal cord and synapses (without interneurons) at the level of L3 in the spinal cord, completely independent of higher centres. From there, an alpha motor neuron conducts an efferent impulse back to the quadriceps femoris muscle, triggering contraction.\n[2] Title: \"Triceps reflex\" Text:  Triceps reflex The triceps reflex, a deep tendon reflex, is a reflex as it involuntary contraction of the triceps brachii muscle. It is initiated by the Cervical (of the neck region) spinal nerve 7 nerve root (the small segment of the nerve that emerges from the spinal cord). The reflex is tested as part of the neurological examination to assess the sensory and motor pathways within the C7 and C8 spinal nerves. The test can be performed by tapping the triceps tendon with the sharp end of a reflex hammer while the forearm is hanging loose at a right angle to the arm.\n[3] Title: Triceps Text:  Ruptures of the triceps muscle are rare, and typically only occur in anabolic steroid users. The triceps reflex, elicited by hitting the triceps, is often used to test the function of the nerves of the arm. This tests spinal nerves C6 and C7, predominately C7. It is sometimes called a three-headed muscle (Latin literally three-headed, \"\"tri\"\" - three, and \"\"ceps\"\", from \"\"caput\"\" - head), because there are three bundles of muscles, each of different origins, joining together at the elbow.\n[4] Title: \"Biceps reflex\" Text:  Biceps reflex Biceps reflex is a reflex test that examines the function of the C5 reflex arc and the C6 reflex arc. The test is performed by using a tendon hammer to quickly depress the biceps brachii tendon as it passes through the cubital fossa. Specifically, the test activates the stretch receptors inside the biceps brachii muscle which communicates mainly with the C5 spinal nerve and partially with the C6 spinal nerve to induce a reflex contraction of the biceps muscle and jerk of the forearm. A strong contraction indicates a 'brisk' reflex, and a weak or absent reflex is known as 'diminished'.\n[5] Title: \"Biceps reflex\" Text:  Brisk or absent reflexes are used as clues to the location of neurological disease. Typically brisk reflexes are found in lesions of upper motor neurons, and absent or reduced reflexes are found in lower motor neuron lesions. A change to the biceps reflex indicates pathology at the level of musculocutaneous nerve, segment C5/6 or at some point above it in the spinal cord or brain.

The December 31, 1999 issue of \"\"Time\"\" named Albert Einstein the \"\"Person of the Century\"\".\n[2] Title: \"Time Person of the Year\" Text:  Most were named Man or Person of the Year either the year they were elected or while they were in office; the only one to be given the title before being elected is Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1944 as Supreme Commander of the Allied Invasion Force, eight years before his election. He subsequently received the title again in 1959, while in office. Franklin D. Roosevelt is the only person to have received the title three times, first as president-elect (1932) and later as the incumbent president (1934 and 1941).\n[3] Title: \"Time Person of the Year\" Text:  Franklin D. Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi were chosen as runners-up. Despite the magazine's frequent statements to the contrary, the designation is often regarded as an honor, and spoken of as an award or prize, simply based on many previous selections of admirable people. However, \"\"Time\"\" magazine points out that controversial figures such as Adolf Hitler (1938), Joseph Stalin (1939 and 1942), Nikita Khrushchev (1957) and Ayatollah Khomeini (1979) have also been granted the title for their impacts. As a result of the public backlash it received from the United States for naming Khomeini as Man of the Year in 1979, \"\"Time\"\" has since shied away from using figures who are controversial in the United States for commercial reasons, fearing reductions in sales or advertising revenue.\n[4] Title: \"Time Person of the Year\" Text:  On November 24, 2017, U.S. president Donald Trump posted on the social media network Twitter that \"\"Time\"\" editors had told him he would \"\"probably\"\" be named Person of the Year for a second time, conditional on an interview and photo shoot which he had refused. \"\"Time\"\" denied that they had made any such promises or conditions to Trump, who was named a runner-up. \"\"Time\"\" magazine also holds an online poll for the readers to vote for who they believe to be the \"\"Person of the Year\"\".\n[5] Title: \"Donald Trump\" Text:  He uses Twitter as a direct means of communication with the public, sidelining the press. Many of the assertions he tweeted have been proven false. In December 2016, \"\"Time\"\" named Trump as its \"\"Person of the Year\"\". In an interview on \"\"The Today Show\"\", he said he was honored by the award, but he took issue with the magazine for referring to him as the \"\"President of the Divided States of America.\"\" In the same month, he was named \"\"Financial Times\"\" Person of the Year.\nQuestion: who was named time person of the year\nYour answer: ",

In addition to designing an effective three-point belt, Bohlin demonstrated its effectiveness in a study of 28,000 accidents in Sweden. Unbelted occupants sustained fatal injuries throughout the whole speed scale, whereas none of the belted occupants were fatally injured at accident speeds below 60 mph. No belted occupant was fatally injured if the passenger compartment remained intact. Bohlin was granted for the device. The world's first seat belt law was put in place in 1970, in the state of Victoria, Australia, making the wearing of a seat belt compulsory for drivers and front-seat passengers.\n[2] Title: \"Seat belt legislation\" Text:  Seat belt legislation Seat belt legislation requires the fitting of seat belts to motor vehicles and the wearing of seat belts by motor vehicle occupants to be mandatory. Laws requiring the fitting of seat belts to cars have in some cases been followed by laws mandating their use, with the effect that thousands of deaths on the road have been prevented. Different laws apply in different countries to the wearing of seat belts. In Australia, after the introduction of mandatory front outboard mounting points in 1964, the use of seat belts by all vehicle passengers was made compulsory in the states of Victoria and South Australia in 1970 and 1971, respectively.\n[3] Title: \"Seat belt legislation\" Text:  By 1973, the use of fitted seat belts by vehicle occupants was made compulsory for the rest of Australia and some other countries during the 1970s and 1980s. The subsequent dramatic decline in road deaths is generally because of seat belt laws and subsequent road safety campaigns. Seat belts are not required for bus occupants, reversing drivers, and those driving some slow moving vehicles. The laws for these differ depending on the state or territory with jurisdiction. All provinces in Canada have primary enforcement seat belt laws. In 1976, Ontario was the first province to pass a law which required vehicle occupants to wear seat belts.\n[4] Title: \"Don Dunstan\" Text:  From 1970 to 1973, much legislation passed through the South Australian Parliament. Workers saw increases in welfare, drinking laws were further liberalised, an Ombudsman was created, censorship was liberalised, seat belts were made mandatory, the education system was overhauled, and the public service was gradually increased (doubling in size during the Dunstan era). Adelaide's water supply was fluoridated in 1971 and the age of majority was lowered from 21 to 18. A Commissioner of Consumer Affairs was created, a demerit point system was introduced to penalise poor driving practices in an attempt to cut the road toll, and compensation for workers was improved.\n[5] Title: \"Road transport in Australia\" Text:  Seat belt usage is very high and it is illegal to not wear a seatbelt. Several efforts have been made at educating the mass population about road safety, the most prominent and successful being the Victorian state Transport Accident Commission (TAC) road safety advertisements, which began in the late-1980s in print and television, which often depicted horrific and graphic road accidents initiated by various causes such as speed, alcohol and drug use, distraction, fatigue and many others. The TAC ads were very effective and reduced the road toll drastically.\nQuestion: when was the seat belt law introduced in australia\nYour answer: ",

All teams will play on Opening Day, which for 2018 will be held on March 29. \"\"Sunday Night Baseball\"\" will no longer be played on the final Sunday before the All-Star Game, in order to ease travel time for those who are participating in the Home Run Derby. A single, nationally televised afternoon game will be played the following Thursday, with all other teams returning to play on Friday.\n[3] Title: \"Major League Baseball schedule\" Text:  Major League Baseball schedule The Major League Baseball (MLB) season schedule consists of 162 games for each of the 30 teams in the American League (AL) and National League (NL), played over approximately six months\u2014a total of 2,430 games, plus the postseason. The regular season runs from late March/early April to late September/early October, followed by the postseason which can run to early November. The season begins with the official Opening Day, and, as of 2018, runs 26\u00bd weeks through the last Sunday of September or first Sunday of October.\n[4] Title: \"Major League Baseball\" Text:  The current MLB regular season, consisting of 162 games per team, typically begins on the first Sunday in April and ends on the first Sunday in October. Each team's schedule is typically organized into three-game series, with occasional two- or four-game series. Postponed games or continuations of suspended games can result in an ad hoc one-game or five-game series. A team's series are organized into homestands and road trips that group multiple series together. Teams generally play games five to seven days per week, commonly having Monday or Thursday as an off day.\n[5] Title: \"Opening Day\" Text:  Opening Day Opening Day is the day on which professional baseball leagues begin their regular season. For Major League Baseball and most of the minor leagues, this day typically falls during the first week of April. For baseball fans, Opening Day serves as a symbol of rebirth; writer Thomas Boswell once penned a book titled, \"\"Why Time Begins on Opening Day\"\". Many feel that the occasion represents a newness or a chance to forget last season, in that all 30 of the major league clubs and their millions of fans begin with 0\u20130 records.\nQuestion: when does the mlb regular season start in 2018\nYour answer: ",

An alternate\n[3] Title: Ushanka Text:  Mink fur ushankas are widely used in the Arctic regions of Russia, protecting the ears and chin of the wearer even from \"\"deep frost\"\", which is around . Hats with fur earflaps have been known in Russia, Ukraine, Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Georgia, and Armenia for centuries. The standard modern ushanka with a perfectly round crown was developed in the 20th century. During the Russian Civil War, the ruler of Siberia, Aleksandr Kolchak, introduced a winter uniform hat, commonly referred to as a \"\"kolchakovka\"\", c. 1918.\n[4] Title: Ushanka Text:  The dense fur also offers some protection against blunt impacts to the head. The word \"\"ushanka\"\" derives from \"\"ushi\"\" (\u0443\u0301\u0448\u0438), \"\"ears\"\" in Russian. Ushankas are often made from inexpensive sheepskin (\"\"tsigeyka\"\", ), rabbit or muskrat fur. Artificial fur hats are also manufactured and are referred to as \"\"fish fur\"\" since the material is not from any real animal. The simplest \"\"fish fur\"\" of \"\"ushanka\"\"s was made of wool pile with cloth substrate and cloth top, with the exception of the flaps, which had the pile exposed.\n[5] Title: \"Fake fur\" Text:  Lately, fake fur has been increasingly used in the mainstream teen fashion, for example the stores Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle use it for trapper hats and jackets. In the Soviet, and now Russian Army, \"\"fish fur\"\" is used as a slang term for the fake fur used on winter clothing and the ubiquitous ushanka hats. Similarly, fashion design labels such as Ralph Lauren and Chanel have promoted the use of fake fur in their collections.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Nucleic acid\" Text:  Ribonucleic acid (RNA) functions in converting genetic information from genes into the amino acid sequences of proteins. The three universal types of RNA include transfer RNA (tRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Messenger RNA acts to carry genetic sequence information between DNA and ribosomes, directing protein synthesis. Ribosomal RNA is a major component of the ribosome, and catalyzes peptide bond formation. Transfer RNA serves as the carrier molecule for amino acids to be used in protein synthesis, and is responsible for decoding the mRNA.\n[2] Title: \"Gene expression\" Text:  For some RNA (non-coding RNA) the mature RNA is the final gene product. In the case of messenger RNA (mRNA) the RNA is an information carrier coding for the synthesis of one or more proteins. mRNA carrying a single protein sequence (common in eukaryotes) is monocistronic whilst mRNA carrying multiple protein sequences (common in prokaryotes) is known as polycistronic. Every mRNA consists of three parts: a 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), a protein-coding region or open reading frame (ORF), and a 3' untranslated region (3'UTR).\n[3] Title: RNA Text:  Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries information about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is coded so that every three nucleotides (a codon) corresponds to one amino acid. In eukaryotic cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its introns\u2014non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form with the help of tRNA.\n[4] Title: EF-Tu Text:  Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the genetic information that encodes the primary structure of a protein, and contains codons that code for each amino acid. The ribosome creates the protein chain by following the mRNA code and integrating the amino acid of an aminoacyl-tRNA (also known as a charged tRNA) to the growing polypeptide chain. There are three sites on the ribosome for tRNA binding. These are the aminoacyl/acceptor site (abbreviated A), the peptidyl site (abbreviated P), and the exit site (abbreviated E). The P-site holds the tRNA connected to the polypeptide chain being synthesized, and the A-site is the binding site for a charged tRNA with an anticodon complementary to the mRNA codon associated with the site.\n[5] Title: \"Messenger RNA\" Text:  Each codon encodes for a specific amino acid, except the stop codons, which terminate protein synthesis. This process of translation of codons into amino acids requires two other types of RNA: Transfer RNA (tRNA), that mediates recognition of the codon and provides the corresponding amino acid, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), that is the central component of the ribosome's protein-manufacturing machinery. The existence of mRNA was first suggested by Jacques Monod and Fran\u00e7ois Jacob, and subsequently discovered by Jacob, Sydney Brenner and Matthew Meselson at the California Institute of Technology in 1961.\nQuestion: types of rnas carries information for making a single type of protein\nYour answer: ",

The dictionary's treatment of \"\"ain't\"\" was subject to particular scorn, since it seemed to overrule the near-unanimous denunciation of that word by English teachers. Since the 1961 publication of the \"\"Third\"\", Merriam-Webster has reprinted the main text of the dictionary with only minor corrections. To add new words, they created an \"\"Addenda Section\"\" in 1966, included in the front matter, which was expanded in 1971, 1976, 1981, 1986, 1993, and 2002.\n[2] Title: \"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\" Text:  The dictionary's treatment of \"\"ain't\"\" was subject to particular scorn, since it seemed to overrule the near-unanimous denunciation of that word by English teachers. The \"\"New Yorker\"\" ran a cartoon showing a receptionist at the dictionary's office telling a visitor that \"\"Dr. Gove ain't in.\"\" The entry said, \"\"though disapproved by many and more common in less educated speech, used orally in most parts of the U.S. by many cultivated speakers esp. in the phrase \"\"ain't I\"\"\"\".\n[3] Title: \"English auxiliaries and contractions\" Text:  \"\"An't\"\" (sometimes \"\"a'n't\"\") arose from \"\"am not\"\" (via \"\"amn't\"\") and \"\"are not\"\" almost simultaneously. \"\"An't\"\" first appears in print in the work of English Restoration playwrights. In 1695 \"\"an't\"\" was used as a contraction of \"\"am not\"\", and as early as 1696 \"\"an't\"\" was used to mean \"\"are not\"\".\n[4] Title: \"English auxiliaries and contractions\" Text:  \"\"An't\"\" with a long \"\"a\"\" sound began to be written as \"\"ain't\"\", which first appears in writing in 1749. By the time \"\"ain't\"\" appeared, \"\"an't\"\" was already being used for \"\"am not\"\", \"\"are not\"\", and \"\"is not\"\". \"\"An't\"\" and \"\"ain't\"\" coexisted as written forms well into the nineteenth century.\n[5] Title: \"Reforms of French orthography\" Text:  Most importantly, all \"\"oi\"\" digraphs that represented were changed to \"\"ai,\"\" thus changing the whole imperfect conjugation of all verbs. The borrowing of \"\"connoisseur\"\" into English predates this change; the modern French spelling is \"\"\"\". The spelling of some plural words whose singular form ended in \"\"D\"\" and \"\"T\"\" was modified to reinsert this mute consonant, so as to bring the plural in morphological alignment with the singular.

Subsequently, crude oil production for refineries was reduced further to as little as per day during the regime of Sanni Abacha. There are four major oil refineries: the Warri Refinery and Petrochemical Plant which can process of crude per day, the New Port Harcourt Refinery which can produce per day (there is also an 'Old' Port Harcourt Refinery with negligible production), as well as the now defunct Kaduna Refinery. The Port Harcourt and Warri Refineries both operate at only 30% capacity.\n[2] Title: \"Petroleum industry in Nigeria\" Text:  A new license covering was given to Shell D'arcy Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, a consortium of Shell and British Petroleum (then known as Anglo-Iranian). The company began exploratory work in 1937. The consortium was granted license to explore oil all over the territory of Nigeria but the acreage allotted to the company in the original license was reduced in 1951 and then between 1955 and 1957. Drilling activities started in 1951 with the first test well drilled in Owerri area. Oil was discovered in non-commercial quantities at Akata, near Eket in 1953.\n[3] Title: \"Petroleum industry in Nigeria\" Text:  Prior to the discovery of oil, Nigeria (like many other African countries) strongly relied on agricultural exports to other countries to supply their economy. Many Nigerians thought the developers were looking for palm oil. But after nearly 50 years searching for oil in the country, Shell-BP discovered the oil at Oloibiri in the Niger Delta. The first oil field began production in 1958. After that, the economy of Nigeria should have seemingly have experienced a strong increase. However, competition for the profits from oil created a great level of terror and conflict for those living in the region.\n[4] Title: \"Petroleum industry in Nigeria\" Text:  Other states such as those of Itsekiri domain of Warri sprang up at this time as well. The eastern Niger Delta region has the Efik people (Annang / Efik / Ibibio who are all related with a common language and ancestors who were all referred to as Efik or Calabar people in early Nigerian history). Their capital city of Calabar, located at the coastal southeast of Nigeria (eastern Niger Delta) served as the major trading and shipping center during the pre-colonial and colonial period. Calabar also served as the first capital of Nigeria and the point of entry of Western religion and Western education into southeastern Nigeria.\n[5] Title: Petrochemistry Text:  The first commercial oil well was set up in 1859, two years after which the first oil refinery was set up. The industry grew in the late 1940s. Demand for products from the petrochemical industry grew during the World War II. The demand for synthetic materials increased, and this rising demand was met by replacing costly and sometimes less efficient products with these synthetic materials. This caused petrochemical processing to develop into a major industry. Before this, petrochemical industry was a tentative sector where various experiments could be carried out. The industry used basic materials: synthetic rubbers in the 1900s, Bakelite, the first petrochemical-derived plastic in 1907, the first petrochemical solvents in the 1920s, polystyrene in the 1930s.\nQuestion: where was the first petro-chemical industry established in nigeria\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Dihydrolipoyl transacetylase\" Text:  The various parts of cellular respiration take place in different parts of the cell. In eukaryotes, glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, pyruvate decarboxylation in the mitochondria, the citric acid cycle within the mitochondrial matrix, and oxidative phosphorylation via the electron transport chain on the mitochondrial cristae. Thus pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes (containing the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase enzymes) are found in the mitochondria of eukaryotes (and simply in the cytosol of prokaryotes). Pyruvate decarboxylation requires a few cofactors in addition to the enzymes that make up the complex. The first is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is used by pyruvate dehydrogenase to oxidize pyruvate and to form a hydroxyethyl-TPP intermediate.\n[2] Title: Glycosome Text:  These processes include glycolysis, purine salvage, beta oxidation of fatty acids, and ether lipid synthesis. The main function that the glycosome serves is of the glycolytic pathway that is done inside its membrane. By compartmentalizing glycolysis inside of the glycosome, the cell can be more successful. In the cell, action in the cytosol, the mitochondria, and the glycosome are all completing the function of energy metabolism. This energy metabolism generates ATP through the process of glycolysis. The glycosome is a host of the main glycolytic enzymes in the pathway for glycolysis.\n[3] Title: Glycosome Text:  This pathway is used to break down fatty acids for their carbon and energy. The entire process of glycolysis does not take place in the glycosome however. Rather, only the Embden-Meyerhof segment where the glucose enters into the glycosome. Importantly, the process in the organelle has no net ATP synthesis. This ATP comes later from processes outside of the glycosome. Inside of the glycosome does need NAD+ for functioning and its regeneration. Fructose 1,6-biphosphate is used in the glycosome as a way to help obtain oxidizing agents to help start glycolysis.\n[4] Title: Glycosome Text:  The glycosome converts the sugar into 3-phosphoglycerate. Another function of glycosomes is purine salvage. The parasites which have glycosomes present in their cells cannot make purine de novo. This purine that is made in the glycosome is then exported out of the glycosome to be used in the cell in nucleic acid. In other cells the enzymes responsible for this are present in the cytosol. These enzymes found in the glycosome to help with synthesis are guanine and adenine phosphoribosyl transferase, hypoxanthine, and xanthine pho tran. All of these enzymes contain a PTS1 sequence at their carboxyl sequence so that they are sent to the glycosome.\n[5] Title: Glycosome Text:  Glycosome The glycosome is a membrane-enclosed organelle that contains the glycolytic enzymes. The term was first used by Scott and Still in 1968 after they realized that the glycogen in the cell was not static but rather a dynamic molecule. It is found in a few species of protozoa including the Kinetoplastida which included the suborders Trypanosomatina and Bodonina, most notably in the human pathogenic trypanosomes, which can cause sleeping sickness and Chagas's disease, and leishmaniasis. The organelle is bounded by a single membrane and contains a dense proteinaceous matrix. It is believed to have evolved from the peroxisome.\nQuestion: where does glycosis take place in the cell\nYour answer: ",

The notes that the panerusan instruments play are largely in melodic formulas known as cengkok and sekaran. These are selected from a huge collection which every performer carries in his head, based on the patet, mood, and traditions surrounding a piece. Sekaran (Javanese for \"\"flowering\"\") is a type of elaboration used in the Javanese gamelan, especially on the \"\"bonang barung\"\".\n[2] Title: Cengkok Text:  Cengkok C\u00e9ngkok (old orthography: chengkok) are patterns played by the elaborating instruments in the Javanese gamelan. They are melodic formula that lead to a \"\"s\u00e8l\u00e8h\"\", following the rules of the \"\"pathet\"\" of the piece. The most elaborate \"\"cengkok\"\" repertoire is that of the \"\"gend\u00e9r barung\"\". The \"\"gambang\"\" and \"\"siter\"\", on the other hand, do not have such formalized sets of \"\"cengkok\"\", and therefore may vary more from performer to performer.\n[3] Title: Cengkok Text:  Most \"\"cengkok\"\" derive from the vocal repertoire, and many have names that originally came from lyrics, like the well-known \"\"Ayu kuning\"\". They may incorporate pre-existent melodic patterns through a process of centonization. Cengkok C\u00e9ngkok (old orthography: chengkok) are patterns played by the elaborating instruments in the Javanese gamelan.

It can be used with elaborating instruments. It is a concept used in Javanese gamelan music, describing melodic tempo and relationships in density between the balungan, elaborating instruments, and gong structure. It is distinct from tempo (Javanese: \"\"Laya\"\"), as each \"\"Irama\"\" can be played in different tempi. \"\"Irama\"\" thus combines \"\"the rate of temporal flow and temporal density\"\"; and the temporal density is the primary factor.\nQuestion: in javanese gamelan music typical elaborating instruments are\nYour answer: ",

The novel, told in first person perspective, tells the story of a fictional geisha working in Kyoto, Japan, before and after World War II. In 2005, a film version was released. At the age of nine, Chiyo Sakamoto (\u5742\u672c\u5343\u4ee3) is taken from her poverty-stricken fishing village of Yoroido (\u93a7\u6238) on the coast of the Sea of Japan with her older sister Satsu (\u5742\u672c\u85a9) and sold to an okiya (geisha boarding house) in Gion, the most prominent geisha district in Kyoto.\n[2] Title: \"Memoirs of a Geisha (film)\" Text:  Production took place in southern and northern California and in several locations in Kyoto, including the Kiyomizu temple and the Fushimi Inari shrine. The film tells the story of a young Japanese girl, Chiyo Sakamoto, who is sold by her impoverished family to a geisha house called an okiya. Chiyo is eventually transformed into a geisha and renamed \"\"Sayuri\"\", and becomes one of the most celebrated geisha of her time. But with this success, Sayuri also learns the secrets and sacrifices of the geisha lifestyle. The film was released to mixed reviews from western critics, but was a box office hit and was nominated for and won numerous awards, including nominations for six Academy Awards, and eventually won three: Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.\n[3] Title: \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" Text:  Iwasaki later went on to write an autobiography, which shows a very different picture of twentieth-century geisha life than the one shown in Golden's novel. The book was published as \"\"Geisha, a Life\"\" in the U.S. and \"\"Geisha of Gion\"\" in the U.K. In 2005, film director Rob Marshall made a film version of the novel. It stars the Chinese actresses Zhang Ziyi as Sayuri, Gong Li as Hatsumomo, and Michelle Yeoh as Mameha; and Japanese actors Ken Watanabe as the Chairman, Suzuka Ohgo as Sayuri's childhood incarnation Chiyo, and Youki Kudoh as the adult Pumpkin.\n[4] Title: \"Memoirs of a Geisha (film)\" Text:  Memoirs of a Geisha (film) Memoirs of a Geisha is an 2005 American epic drama film based on the novel of the same name by Arthur Golden, produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and Spyglass Entertainment and by Douglas Wick's Red Wagon Productions.

Paul Rudd was cast in the part of Tommy, which marked his first starring role before he appeared in \"\"Clueless\"\" (1995). The leading female role, Kara, was given to Marianne Hagan; however, Hagan has since stated that Miramax executives Bob and Harvey Weinstein did not favor her for the part, and made aesthetic criticisms about her being \"\"too thin\"\" and her chin being \"\"too pointy\"\".\n[3] Title: \"Michael Myers (Halloween)\" Text:  (1995) takes place six years after the events of \"\"The Revenge of Michael Myers\"\"; both Jamie (J.

The character had been created by Boris Karloff for the stage version, and a running gag in the play and the film was the character's resemblance to Karloff. Even though the film was released in 1944, it was shot in 1941, at which time Karloff still was contracted to the Broadway play and could not be released for the filming (unlike his costars Josephine Hull, Jean Adair and John Alexander). Massey and Karloff had appeared together earlier in James Whale's suspense film \"\"The Old Dark House\"\" (1932).\n[2] Title: \"Arsenic and Old Lace (film)\" Text:  Capra had also approached Jack Benny and Ronald Reagan before learning that Grant would accept the role. Boris Karloff played Jonathan Brewster, who \"\"looks like Karloff,\"\" on the Broadway stage, but he was unable to do the film as well because he was still appearing in the play during filming, and Raymond Massey took his place. The film's supporting cast also features Priscilla Lane, Jack Carson, Edward Everett Horton and Peter Lorre. Josephine Hull and Jean Adair portray the Brewster sisters, Abby and Martha, respectively.\n[3] Title: \"Bela Lugosi\" Text:  Bela took over the role of Jonathan Brewster from Boris Karloff for \"\"Arsenic and Old Lace\"\". Bela had also expressed interest in playing Elwood P. Dowd in \"\"Harvey\"\" to help himself professionally. He also made plenty of personal appearances to promote his horror image and/or an accompanying film. Late in his life, Bela Lugosi again received star billing in films when ambitious filmmaker Ed Wood, a fan of Lugosi, found him living in obscurity and near-poverty and offered him roles in his films, such as an anonymous narrator in \"\"Glen or Glenda\"\" and a Dr. Frankenstein-like mad scientist in \"\"Bride of the Monster\"\".\n[4] Title: \"Raymond Massey\" Text:  Raymond Massey Raymond Hart Massey (August 30, 1896 \u2013 July 29, 1983) was a Canadian-American actor, known for his commanding, stage-trained voice. For his lead role in \"\"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\"\" (1940), Massey was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. He also was well known for playing Dr. Gillespie in the NBC television series \"\"Dr. Kildare\"\" (1961\u20131966). Today he is most often seen in his role as the malevolent Jonathan Brewster, who looks like Boris Karloff, and violently attacks anyone who mentions the resemblance, in \"\"Arsenic and Old Lace\"\" (1944).\n[5] Title: \"Arsenic and Old Lace (play)\" Text:  Later revivals in the 1940s and 1950s had Bela Lugosi playing the role of Jonathan Brewster with box office returns reflecting better sales than when Boris Karloff traveled through the same cities. In 1965, Sybil Thorndike, Athene Seyler and Richard Briers appeared in the play in London. The play is still widely performed and has been translated into many languages, including a Russian film. A Broadway revival of the play ran from June 26, 1986, to January 3, 1987, at the 46th Street Theatre in New York, starring Polly Holliday, Jean Stapleton, Tony Roberts and Abe Vigoda.\nQuestion: who played jonathan in arsenic and old lace\nYour answer: ",

In 2017 Olympic sprinter Christian Coleman ran a time of 4.12 seconds on turf in response to claims that NFL players are as fast as Usain Bolt. This is a list of the official 40-yard dash results of 4.30 seconds or better recorded at the NFL Scouting combine since 1999, the first year electronic timing was implemented at the NFL Scouting Combine. According to a five-year NFL combine report, wide receivers and cornerbacks had the fastest average times at 4.48, followed by running backs at 4.49.\n[4] Title: \"40-yard dash\" Text:  Jacoby Ford, who ran a 4.28 s in the 2010 NFL Combine, had a collegiate best of 6.51 s in the 60-meter dash (outside the top-40 of the all-time lists).

Auburn's Bo Jackson claims to have run a 40-yard dash with a time of 4.13 s. A time of 4.18 run by Jackson within the same week added some support to the legitimacy of the times.

The cultural role of Buda was particularly significant during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus. The Italian Renaissance had a great influence on the city. His library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, was Europe's greatest collection of historical chronicles and philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century, and second only in size to the Vatican Library. After the foundation of the first Hungarian university in P\u00e9cs in 1367 (University of P\u00e9cs), the second one was established in \u00d3buda in 1395 (University of \u00d3buda).\n[2] Title: Budapest Text:  The Hungarians arrived in the territory in the late 9th century. The area was pillaged by the Mongols in 1241. Buda, the settlements on the west bank of the river, became one of the centres of Renaissance humanist culture by the 15th century. The Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 was followed by nearly 150 years of Ottoman rule. After the reconquest of Buda in 1686, the region entered a new age of prosperity. Pest-Buda became a global city with the unification of Buda, \u00d3buda, and Pest on November 17, 1873, with the name 'Budapest' given to the new capital.\n[3] Title: Hungary Text:  In 1873, the old capital Buda and \u00d3buda were officially united with Pest, thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. Many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period. After the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the Hungarian prime minister Istv\u00e1n Tisza and his cabinet tried to avoid the outbreak and escalating of a war in Europe, but their diplomatic efforts were unsuccessful. Austria\u2013Hungary drafted 9 million (fighting forces: 7.8 million) soldiers in World War I (over 4 million from the Kingdom of Hungary) on the side of Germany, Bulgaria and Turkey.\n[4] Title: Austria-Hungary Text:  However, in a comparison with Germany and Britain, the Austro-Hungarian economy as a whole still lagged considerably, as sustained modernization had begun much later. Like the German Empire, that of Austria-Hungary frequently employed liberal economic policies and practices. In 1873, the old Hungarian capital Buda and \u00d3buda (Ancient Buda) were officially merged with the third city, Pest, thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into Hungary's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period.\n[5] Title: Budapest Text:  It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the history of Budapest, lasting until World War I. In 1849 the Chain Bridge linking Buda with Pest was opened as the first permanent bridge across the Danube and in 1873 Buda and Pest were officially merged with the third part, \u00d3buda (Old Buda), thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into the country's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Ethnic Hungarians overtook Germans in the second half of the 19th century due to mass migration from the overpopulated rural Transdanubia and Great Hungarian Plain.\nQuestion: when did budapest became the capital of hungary\nYour answer: ",

Additionally it was also observed by Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, who recorded the comet's passage in the Akbarnama The literature resulting from the passing of the comet was prolific, and these works, as well as the ideas presented by many astronomers, caused much controversy.\n[4] Title: \"Halley's Comet\" Text:  The comet added to the unrest in China on the eve of the Xinhai Revolution that would end the last dynasty in 1911. As James Hutson, a missionary in Sichuan Province at the time, recorded, The people believe that it indicates calamity such as war, fire, pestilence, and a change of dynasty. In some places on certain days the doors were unopened for half a day, no water was carried and many did not even drink water as it was rumoured that pestilential vapour was being poured down upon the earth from the comet.\"\"\n[5] Title: \"Great Comet of 1577\" Text:  This comet was mentioned in the book entitled \"\"S\u00eafer Chazionot - The Book Of Visions - By Rabbi Hayyim ben Joseph Vital: \"\"1577.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Mardi Gras\" Text:  The first Mardi Gras parade held in New Orleans is recorded to have taken place in 1837. The tradition in New Orleans expanded to the point that it became synonymous with the city in popular perception, and embraced by residents of New Orleans beyond those of French or Catholic heritage. Mardi Gras celebrations are part of the basis of the slogan \"\"Laissez les bons temps rouler\"\" (\"\"Let the good times roll\"\"). On Mardi Gras Day, the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, the last parades of the season wrap up and the celebrations come to a close with the Meeting of the Courts (known locally as the Rex Ball).\n[2] Title: \"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\" Text:  Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the \"\"Meeting of the Courts\"\" between Rex and Comus. The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antione Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing).\n[3] Title: \"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\" Text:  An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his book \"\"Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces\"\" describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835: Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun, frolic, and comic masquerading.\n[4] Title: \"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\" Text:  Uptown parades start with one of New Orleans' most prestigious organizations, the Krewe of Proteus. Dating to 1882, it is the second-oldest krewe still parading. The Proteus parade is followed by a newer organization, the music-themed super-Krewe of Orpheus, which is considered less prestigious as it draws a significant portion of its membership from outside of New Orleans. The celebrations begin early on Mardi Gras, which can fall on any Tuesday between February 3 and March 9 (depending on the date of Easter, and thus of Ash Wednesday).\n[5] Title: \"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\" Text:  The city government, essentially bankrupt after Hurricane Katrina, pushed for a scaled back celebration to limit strains on city services. However, many krewes insisted that they wanted to and would be ready to parade, so negotiations between krewe leaders and city officials resulted in a compromise schedule. It was scaled back but less severely than originally suggested. The 2006 New Orleans Carnival schedule included the Krewe du Vieux on its traditional route through Marigny and the French Quarter on February 11, the Saturday two weekends before Mardi Gras. There were several parades on Saturday, February 18, and Sunday the 19th a week before Mardi Gras.\nQuestion: when did mardi gras start in new orleans\nYour answer: ",

Such a system still qualifies as geocentric. It was revived in the Middle Ages by Jean Buridan. Heraclides Ponticus was once thought to have proposed that both Venus and Mercury went around the Sun rather than the Earth, but this is no longer accepted. Martianus Capella definitely put Mercury and Venus in orbit around the Sun. Aristarchus of Samos was the most radical.\n[2] Title: \"Aristarchus of Samos\" Text:  Aristarchus of Samos Aristarchus of Samos (; , \"\"Aristarkhos ho Samios\"\"; c. 310 \u2013 c. 230 BC) was an ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician who presented the first known heliocentric model that placed the Sun at the center of the known universe with the Earth revolving around it. He was influenced by Philolaus of Croton, but Aristarchus identified the \"\"central fire\"\" with the Sun, and he put the other planets in their correct order of distance around the Sun. Like Anaxagoras before him, he suspected that the stars were just other bodies like the Sun, albeit further away from Earth.\n[3] Title: Science Text:  Aristotle maintained that man knows a thing scientifically \"\"when he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain way, and when the first principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with certainty\"\". The Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos (310\u2013230 BCE) was the first to propose a heliocentric model of the universe, with the Sun at the center and all the planets orbiting it. Aristarchus's model was widely rejected because it was believed to violate the laws of physics. The inventor and mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse made major contributions to the beginnings of calculus and has sometimes been credited as its inventor, although his proto-calculus lacked several defining features.\n[4] Title: Heliocentrism Text:  The first person known to have proposed a heliocentric system, however, was Aristarchus of Samos (\"\"c\"\". 270 BC). Like Eratosthenes, Aristarchus calculated the size of the Earth, and measured the sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon. From his estimates, he concluded that the Sun was six to seven times wider than the Earth, and thought the larger object would have the most attractive force. His writings on the heliocentric system are lost, but some information about them is known from a brief description by his contemporary, Archimedes, and from scattered references by later writers.\n[5] Title: \"History of astronomy\" Text:  Aristotle, drawing on the mathematical model of Eudoxus, proposed that the universe was made of a complex system of concentric spheres, whose circular motions combined to carry the planets around the earth. This basic cosmological model prevailed, in various forms, until the 16th century. In the 3rd century BC Aristarchus of Samos was the first to suggest a heliocentric system, although only fragmentary descriptions of his idea survive. Eratosthenes, using the angles of shadows created at widely separated regions, estimated the circumference of the Earth with great accuracy.\nQuestion: who is first on record as proposing a geocentric universe\nYour answer: ",

In Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, \"\"college\"\" refers to the final two years of high school (years 11 and 12), and the institutions which provide this. In this context, \"\"college\"\" is a system independent of the other years of high school. Here, the expression is a shorter version of \"\"matriculation college\"\".\n[2] Title: College Text:  There has also been a recent trend to rename or create government secondary schools as \"\"colleges\"\". In the state of Victoria, some state high schools are referred to as \"\"secondary colleges\"\", although the pre-eminent government secondary school for boys in Melbourne is still named Melbourne High School. In Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, \"\"college\"\" is used in the name of all state high schools built since the late 1990s, and also some older ones. In New South Wales, some high schools, especially multi-campus schools resulting from mergers, are known as \"\"secondary colleges\"\".\n[3] Title: College Text:  The municipal government of the city of Paris uses the phrase \"\"sixth form college\"\" as the English name for a lyc\u00e9e. In some national education systems, secondary schools may be called \"\"colleges\"\" or have \"\"college\"\" as part of their title. In Australia the term \"\"college\"\" is applied to any private or independent (non-government) primary and, especially, secondary school as distinct from a state school. Melbourne Grammar School, Cranbrook School, Sydney and The King's School, Parramatta are considered colleges.\n[4] Title: \"Ninth grade\" Text:  \u2022Technical Drawing: Calligraphy, plan designing, etc. (Related to Mechanics). In Australia, secondary school (sometimes referred to as high school) starts in grade 8 for South Australia and grade 7 for New South Wales, Queensland , Tasmania, Western Australia and Victoria. In Belgium, the 9th grade is called \"\"derde middelbaar\"\" in the Dutch-speaking north and \"\"3\u00e8me secondaire\"\" in the French-speaking south. In some bureaus of the country, the 9th grade can be removed from one's educator curriculum in order to put the student in an appropriate class study level.\n[5] Title: \"Tenth grade\" Text:  While in contrast, in most South Australian public schools, it is the third year of high school. For more in depth information on Australia's education system, see: Education in Australia. In Belgium, the 10th grade is called \"\"4\u00e8me secondaire\"\" in French (Walloon), or \"\"4de middelbaar\"\" in Dutch (Flemish). In Canada, Grade 10 is the 10th year of mandatory schooling. Depending on province, it may be the first (grades 10-12 high school), second (grades 9-12 high school), third (grades 8-12 high school), or fourth year of high school (grades 7-11 high school) .\nQuestion: what do they call high school in australia\nYour answer: ",

As she matures into her young teens, however, Catherine grows close to Edgar Linton, a timid and well-bred young man from the neighbouring estate, \"\"Thrushcross Grange\"\", and accepts his proposal of marriage; but, she insists that her true and only love is Heathcliff. She claims that she cannot marry him because it \"\"would degrade her\"\" and that the two would be beggars were such a union to take place. Nevertheless, she also declares her passion for him in such ways as \"\"whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same\"\", and the famous quote \"\"I \"\"am\"\" Heathcliff.\"\"\n[2] Title: \"Wuthering Heights\" Text:  Hindley descends into drunkenness. Two more years pass, and Catherine and Edgar Linton become friends, while she becomes more distant from Heathcliff. Edgar visits Catherine while Hindley is away, and they declare themselves lovers soon afterwards. Catherine confesses to Nelly that Edgar has proposed marriage and she has accepted, although her love for Edgar is not comparable to her love for Heathcliff, whom she cannot marry because of his low social status and lack of education. She hopes to use her position as Edgar's wife to raise Heathcliff's standing.\n[3] Title: \"Wuthering Heights\" Text:  Heathcliff overhears her say that it would \"\"degrade\"\" her to marry him (but not how much she loves him), and he runs away and disappears without a trace. Distraught over Heathcliff's departure, Catherine makes herself ill. Nelly and Edgar begin to pander to her every whim to prevent her from becoming ill again. Three years pass.

Heathcliff overhears and leaves. Cathy realizes that Heathcliff has overheard, is overcome by guilt and runs out after him into a raging storm. Edgar finds her and nurses her back to health once again, and soon he and Cathy marry. Heathcliff was thought to have disappeared forever but returns two years later, now wealthy and elegant. He has refined his appearance and manners in order to both impress and spite Cathy and secretly buys Wuthering Heights from Hindley, who has become an alcoholic.\n[5] Title: \"Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)\" Text:  This can only be achieved, however, by Heathcliff's forcing his and Isabella's son Linton into marriage with Cathy's daughter, who is called Catherine.

He first appeared in the anthology comic book \"\"Amazing Fantasy\"\" #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, as well as in a number of movies, television shows, and video game adaptations set in the Marvel Universe. In the stories, Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash.\n[2] Title: \"First appearance\" Text:  Like many golden and silver age comics, first appearances often become dated and do not fit the modern portrayal of the character. However, some first appearances are considered classics. 1990s-era Spider-Man writer Howard Mackie said that his favorite story featuring the character was his first appearance and origin story in \"\"Amazing Fantasy\"\" #15 (August 1962), stating that writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko \"\"gave us everything we needed, I wanted or could ask for in the least possible space. Every single person who retells the origin never improves on the original, they simply expand it.\"\"\n[3] Title: \"Spider-Man in video games\" Text:  Spider-Man in video games There are numerous video games featuring the popular Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man that have been released. To date, Spider-Man has made appearances on over 15 gaming platforms, which also includes mobile games on mobile phones. The Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and first appeared in \"\"Amazing Fantasy\"\" #15 (August 1962). By the late 1970s, Spider-Man had become a successful franchise. At this time the fictional character had already featured in the animated series \"\"Spider-Man\"\", a segment on the children's television series \"\"The Electric Company\"\" (called \"\"Spidey Super Stories\"\"), and the live action prime time series \"\"The Amazing Spider-Man\"\".\n[4] Title: \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" Text:  Due to strong sales on the character's first appearance in \"\"Amazing Fantasy\"\" #15, Spider-Man was given his own ongoing series in March 1963. The initial years of the series, under Lee and Ditko, chronicled Spider-Man's nascent career with his civilian life as hard-luck yet perpetually good-humored teenager Peter Parker. Peter balanced his career as Spider-Man with his job as a freelance photographer for \"\"The Daily Bugle\"\" under the bombastic editor-publisher J. Jonah Jameson to support himself and his frail Aunt May. At the same time, Peter dealt with public hostility towards Spider-Man and the antagonism of his classmates Flash Thompson and Liz Allan at Midtown High School, while embarking on a tentative, ill-fated romance with Jameson's secretary, Betty Brant.\n[5] Title: Spider-Man Text:  Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues, and accompanied him with many supporting characters, such as J. Jonah Jameson, Flash Thompson, Harry Osborn, romantic interests Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson, and foes such as Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin and Venom. His origin story has him acquiring spider-related abilities after a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces, shooting spider-webs from wrist-mounted devices, and detecting danger with his \"\"spider-sense\"\". When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist.\nQuestion: when did spider man first appear in comics\nYour answer: ",

In the new part of the town, visitors during the day can shop, but also can enjoy the nightlife, either on one of the numerous cafes or at the restaurants with traditional cuisine.

On the 2001 album \"\"Pieces of Me\"\" by singer/songwriter Lori McKenna, the song \"\"Pink Sweater\"\" is dedicated to Byrd and condemns his murderers and references their death penalty convictions with the raucous refrain, \"\"I'll be the one in the pink sweater, dancing around when you're gone.\"\"\n[2] Title: \"Debbie Gibson\" Text:  It was an Adult contemporary-heavy album consisting of piano and keyboard ballads recorded predominantly with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The album's producer, Niko Bolas, who was usually Neil Young's co-producer, was producing the reunion album for veteran punk band Circle Jerks, and invited Gibson to a recording session for that band's album. She sang background vocals on the song \"\"I Wanna Destroy You\"\", as well as appearing at and participating in the Circle Jerks' performance at punk venue CBGB, wearing one of the band's T-shirts and sharing a microphone with frontman Keith Morris.\n[3] Title: \"Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities\" Text:  The album is out of print. The album was produced by Niko Bolas, known for his work with Neil Young, Warren Zevon, Melissa Etheridge and Kiss. \"\"I Wanna Destroy You,\"\" a cover of a song by the Soft Boys, featured backing vocals from pop singer/songwriter Deborah Gibson, who had just finished a solo album with the same producer the Circle Jerks were using. Gibson later made a surprise appearance at a Circle Jerks performance at punk mecca CBGB to perform the song with the band.\n[4] Title: \"The Man Don't Give a Fuck\" Text:  However, the live re-issue of \"\"The Man Don't Give A Fuck\"\" broke that record. The song was originally intended as a B-side for previous single \"\"If You Don't Want Me to Destroy You\"\" but the group had not been able to clear the sample in time. However, they persevered and when they were able to clear the sample, released the song as a single in its own right. This arguably sealed the song's cult status among SFA fans, and it became the group's standard set-closer when playing live: the outro would often extend to ten or twenty minutes, with keyboard player Cian Ciaran in particular taking the opportunity to improvise wildly around the basic sample.\n[5] Title: \"The Man Don't Give a Fuck\" Text:  \"\"The Man Don't Give a Fuck\"\" was issued as a single in December 1996, having originally been set for release as a B-side on Super Furry Animals' previous single \"\"If You Don't Want Me to Destroy You\"\".

A footman comes and tells Mirabell that Waitwell (Mirabell's male servant) and Foible (Lady Wishfort's female servant) were married that morning. Mirabell tells Fainall about his love of Millamant and is encouraged to marry her. Witwoud and Petulant appear and Mirabell is informed that should Lady Wishfort marry, he will lose \u00a36000 of Millamant's inheritance. He will only get this money if he can get Lady Wishfort\u2019s consent to his and Millamant's marriage.\n[2] Title: \"The Way of the World\" Text:  In order for them to marry and receive Millamant's full dowry, Mirabell must receive the blessing of Millamant's aunt, Lady Wishfort. Unfortunately, Lady Wishfort is a very bitter lady who despises Mirabell and wants her own nephew, Sir Wilfull, to wed Millamant. Another character, Fainall, is having a secret affair with Mrs. Marwood, a friend of Mrs. Fainall's, who in turn once had an affair with Mirabell. In the meantime, Mirabell's servant is married to Foible, Lady Wishfort's servant. Waitwell pretends to be Sir Rowland and, on Mirabell's command, tries to trick Lady Wishfort into a false engagement.Above all, all the chararacters in the play are involved to each other in extra marital affairs in an affected way and pretentious way while Mirabell and Millamant go against the currents of the society.\n[3] Title: \"The Way of the World\" Text:  After she leaves, the newly wed servants appear and Mirabell reminds them of their roles in the plan. Acts 3, 4 and 5 are all set in the home of Lady Wishfort. We are introduced to Lady Wishfort who is encouraged by Foible to marry the supposed Sir Rowland \u2013 Mirabell's supposed uncle \u2013 so that Mirabell will lose his inheritance. Sir Rowland is, however, Waitwell in disguise, and the plan is to entangle Lady Wishfort in a marriage which cannot go ahead, because it would be bigamy, not to mention a social disgrace (Waitwell is only a serving man, Lady Wishfort an aristocrat).\n[4] Title: \"The Way of the World\" Text:  Mirabell calls on Waitwell who brings a contract from the time before the marriage of the Fainalls in which Mrs. Fainall gives all her property to Mirabell. This neutralises the blackmail attempts, after which Mirabell restores Mrs. Fainall's property to her possession and then is free to marry Millamant with the full \u00a36000 inheritance. The epigraph found on the title page of the 1700 edition of \"\"The Way of the World\"\" contains two Latin quotations from Horace's \"\"Satires\"\". In their wider contexts they read in English: The quotations offer a forewarning of the chaos to ensue from both infidelity and deception.\n[5] Title: \"The Way of the World\" Text:  By Act 5, Lady Wishfort has found out the plot, and Fainall has had Waitwell arrested. Mrs. Fainall tells Foible that her previous affair with Mirabell is now public knowledge. Lady Wishfort appears with Mrs. Marwood, whom she thanks for unveiling the plot. Fainall then appears and uses the information of Mrs. Fainall's previous affair with Mirabell and Millamant's contract to marry him to blackmail Lady Wishfort, telling that she should never marry and that she is to transfer her fortune to him.

The 12\"\" maxi single's B-side, \"\"Take Another View\"\", a non-album track, often performed live, was included on the 2004 re-issue of \"\"White Feathers\"\", which contained several bonus tracks, including the instrumental version of \"\"Too Shy\"\", originally featured on the B-sides of both the 7\"\" and 12\"\" singles.\n[3] Title: \"Too Shy\" Text:  \"\"Too Shy\"\" is Kajagoogoo's only significant hit in the US, where the band is widely regarded as a one-hit wonder. In the UK, however, Kajagoogoo had further hits, including two more top 10 singles: \"\"Ooh to Be Ah\"\" and \"\"Big Apple\"\", both in 1983. \"\"Too Shy\"\" was written by Kajagoogoo and produced by Duran Duran keyboardist Nick Rhodes and Colin Thurston, the latter of whom had produced Duran Duran's first two albums.\n[4] Title: \"Nick Beggs\" Text:  Chris Hamill (Limahl) joined the band in 1981 and at Beggs' suggestion it was renamed Kajagoogoo. The release of the first single, \"\"Too Shy\"\", in January 1983 saw the band on a promotional tour as the record reached number 1 in the UK Singles Chart. After firing lead singer Limahl and, following a split with Strode, the three remaining band members reformed as 'Kaja'. Between 1985 and 1987, Beggs concentrated on writing with various other songwriters and finally formed Ellis, Beggs, & Howard in March 1987.\n[5] Title: Kajagoogoo Text:  The band signed with EMI Records in July 1982 after Limahl, while working as a waiter at London's Embassy Club, had met Nick Rhodes of the group Duran Duran. Rhodes proceeded to co-produce the band's first single, \"\"Too Shy\"\" with Duran Duran's EMI producer Colin Thurston. The single was released on 10 January 1983 and went on to top the UK Singles Chart (before any of Duran Duran's singles had done so, Rhodes lightheartedly noted).

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Chemical polarity\" Text:  Chemical polarity Polar molecules must contain polar bonds due to a difference in electronegativity between the bonded atoms. A polar molecule with two or more polar bonds must have a geometry which is asymmetric in at least one direction, so that the bond dipoles do not cancel each other. Polar molecules interact through dipole\u2013dipole intermolecular forces and hydrogen bonds. Polarity underlies a number of physical properties including surface tension, solubility, and melting and boiling points. Not all atoms attract electrons with the same force. The amount of \"\"pull\"\" an atom exerts on its electrons is called its electronegativity.\n[2] Title: \"Chemical polarity\" Text:  However, the following properties are typical of such molecules. A molecule is composed of one or more chemical bonds between molecular orbitals of different atoms. A molecule may be polar either as a result of polar bonds due to differences in electronegativity as described above, or as a result of an asymmetric arrangement of nonpolar covalent bonds and non-bonding pairs of electrons known as a full molecular orbital. A polar molecule has a net dipole as a result of the opposing charges (i.e. having partial positive and partial negative charges) from polar bonds arranged asymmetrically.\n[3] Title: \"Chemical polarity\" Text:  A polar molecule with two or more polar bonds must have a geometry which is asymmetric in at least one direction, so that\n[4] Title: \"Chemical polarity\" Text:  One common form of polar interaction is the hydrogen bond, which is also known as the H-bond. For example, water forms H-bonds and has a molar mass M = 18 and a boiling point of +100 \u00b0C, compared to nonpolar methane with M = 16 and a boiling point of \u2013161 \u00b0C. A molecule may be nonpolar either when there is an equal sharing of electrons between the two atoms of a diatomic molecule or because of the symmetrical arrangement of polar bonds in a more complex molecule. For example, boron trifluoride (BF) has a trigonal planar arrangement of three polar bonds at 120\u00b0.\n[5] Title: \"Chemical polarity\" Text:  Water (HO) is an example of a polar molecule since it has a slight positive charge on one side and a slight negative charge on the other. The dipoles do not cancel out resulting in a net dipole. Due to the polar nature of the water molecule itself, polar molecules are generally able to dissolve in water. Other examples include sugars (like sucrose), which have many polar oxygen\u2013hydrogen (\u2212OH) groups and are overall highly polar. If the bond dipole moments of the molecule do not cancel, the molecule is polar.\nQuestion: for a molecule to be polar it must have\nYour answer: ",

Later in the hotel, Hallie sings a few bars of \"\"Let's Get Together\"\", a tune from the first version of the film that was a hit for its star, Hayley Mills. The song is also quoted over the Walt Disney Pictures logo, and at the end of Alan Silvestri's closing credits suite.\n[3] Title: \"Let's Get Together (Hayley Mills song)\" Text:  Let's Get Together (Hayley Mills song) \"\"Let's Get Together\"\" is a song written by Robert and Richard Sherman for the 1961 Disney film \"\"The Parent Trap\"\". It was sung in the film by teen actress Hayley Mills, using double-tracking because she played both the roles of twin sisters, which was a technical feat in the early 1960s. Her British accent is only heard in the spoken line which concludes the bridge section: \"\"Nothing could be greater, say 'Hey Alligator'!!!\"\"\n[4] Title: \"Hayley Mills\" Text:  Because Mills could not be present to receive the trophy, Annette Funicello accepted it for her. Disney subsequently cast Mills as twins Sharon and Susan who reunite their divorced parents in \"\"The Parent Trap\"\". In the film, Mills sings \"\"Let's Get Together\"\" as a duet with herself.

This was followed by successive ration schemes for meat, tea, jam, biscuits, breakfast cereals, cheese, eggs, lard, milk, and canned and dried fruit. In June 1942 the Combined Food Board was set up by Great Britain and the United States to coordinate the world supply of food to the Allies, with special attention to flows from the U.S. and Canada to Britain. Almost all foods apart from vegetables and bread were rationed by August 1942.\n[2] Title: \"Rationing in the United Kingdom\" Text:  The standard rations during the Second World War were as follows. Quantities are \"\"per week\"\" unless otherwise stated. 1s 2d bought about of meat. Offal and sausages were only rationed from 1942 to 1944. When sausages were not rationed, the meat needed to make them was so scarce that they often contained a high proportion of bread. Eggs were rationed and \"\"allocated to ordinary consumers as available\"\"; in 1944 thirty allocations of one egg each were made. Children and some invalids were allowed three a week; expectant mothers two on each allocation.\n[3] Title: \"Rationing in the United Kingdom\" Text:  As the war progressed rationing was extended to other commodities such as clothing. Clothing was rationed on a points system. When it was introduced, on 1 June 1941, no clothing coupons had been issued, and at first the unused margarine coupons in ration books were valid for clothing. Initially the allowance was for about one new outfit per year; as the war progressed the points were reduced, until buying a coat used almost a year's clothing coupons. On 1 July 1942 the basic civilian petrol ration was abolished; this had been announced on 13 March 1942.\n[4] Title: \"Rationing in the United Kingdom\" Text:  Arrangements were made for vegetarians so that other goods were substituted for their rations of meat. Milk was supplied at each week with priority for expectant mothers and children under 5; for those under 18; children unable to attend school , certain invalids up to . Each consumer received one tin of milk powder (equivalent to ) every eight weeks.

Balloons and sugar for cakes for birthday parties were partially or completely unavailable. Many fathers saved bits of wood to build toys for Christmas presents, and Christmas trees were almost impossible to obtain due to timber rationing. On 8 May 1945, the Second World War ended in Europe, but rationing continued. Some aspects of rationing became stricter for some years after the war.

In 2002, Static would be contacted by Jonathan Davis of the nu metal band Korn. Davis had recently signed on to provide the soundtrack for the \"\"Queen of the Damned\"\" film soundtrack, but due to contract limitations with Sony, was legally unable to actually perform the music he had written for the soundtrack. As a remedy of this, Davis contacted a number of metal vocalists, Static included, to sing on the songs he had written.\n[4] Title: Static-X Text:  Static provided vocals for one track, \"\"Not Meant for Me\"\", with the \"\"Queen of the Damned\"\" soundtrack releasing in February 2002. The contribution would be a turning point for the band; the track, which was much more melodic than much of the band's music up until that point, would attract the attention of Warner Brother's executive Tom Whalley, who pressured the band as a whole to pursue a melodic sound. Personnel and line-up changes would further alter the band's sound.\n[5] Title: \"Shadow Zone (Static-X album)\" Text:  As a remedy of this, Davis contacted a number of metal vocalists, Static included, to sing on the songs he had written.

Acting upon the recommendations of the document, Ontario formally eliminated grade 13 in 1984, and introduced the Ontario Academic Credit system. The new system allowed for students to graduate from secondary schools in four years, while also maintaining the fifth year, known as OAC, which had courses catering for students planning to proceed with post-secondary education.\n[2] Title: \"Ontario Academic Credit\" Text:  A subsequent recommendation in 1968, in the Hall-Dennis Report, also called for the elimination of grade 13. In spite of these recommendations, however, grade 13 was maintained by the Ontario government. A significant opposition amongst parents, businesses and universities regarding the education reforms had surfaced by the 1970s, in which they believed there was a decline in academic standards, a lack of focus in the curriculum, and lax discipline in schools. Combined with financially pressured school boards beginning to call for the abolition of grade 13 as a means of financial restraint, this resulted in the government reevaluating its secondary education system.\n[3] Title: \"Ontario Academic Credit\" Text:  However, the commission's report was shelved after five years, in part due its potential to re-open the politically sensitive issue of separate school funding and in part due to the Minister of Education's prior interference in curriculum redesign a year earlier. The threat to the fifth year of secondary school education in Ontario grew significantly during the 1960s, with growing opposition to the grade 13 departmental examinations from parents. This led to the establishment of the Grade 13 Study Committee in 1964 by Minister of Education Bill Davis, which recommended the elimination of both the departmental examinations, and grade 13.\n[4] Title: \"Ontario Academic Credit\" Text:  Ontario Academic Credit The Ontario Academic Credit or OAC ( or CPO) was a fifth year of secondary school education that previously existed in the province of Ontario, Canada, designed for students preparing for post-secondary education. The OAC curriculum was codified by the Ontario Ministry of Education in \"\"Ontario Schools: Intermediate and Senior\"\" (OS:IS) and its revisions. The Ontario education system had five years of secondary education, known as Grade 13 from 1921 to 1988; grade 13 was replaced by OAC for students starting high school (grade 9) in 1984.\n[5] Title: \"Ontario Academic Credit\" Text:  OAC continued to act as a fifth year of secondary education until it was phased out in 2003. The fifth year in the Ontario secondary school system had existed in Ontario for 82 years, from 1921 to 2003, first as Grade 13, and then as the Ontario Academic Credit. The first attempt to reform the education system in Ontario was initiated in 1945, with the Royal Commission on Education, which proposed a three-tiered education system with six years of elementary education, followed by four years of secondary education, and culminating in three years of junior colleges.\nQuestion: when did ontario get rid of grade 13\nYour answer: ",

As all the major networks had flipped to full color schedules by 1966, the special was likewise produced in color, establishing the Grinch's color (white in the two-tone illustrations of the original book) as green, a convention used in later television specials featuring the character as well as the 2000 and 2018 film adaptations.\n[4] Title: \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!

In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. It is believed that Easter Island's Polynesian inhabitants arrived on Easter Island sometime near 1200 AD. They created a thriving and industrious culture, as evidenced by the island's numerous enormous stone \"\"moai\"\" and other artifacts.\n[4] Title: \"Easter Island\" Text:  The current Polynesian name of the island, \"\"Rapa Nui\"\" (\"\"Big Rapa\"\"), was coined after the slave raids of the early 1860s, and refers to the island's topographic resemblance to the island of Rapa in the Bass Islands of the Austral Islands group. However, Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl argued that \"\"Rapa\"\" was the original name of Easter Island and that \"\"Rapa Iti\"\" was named by refugees from there. The phrase \"\"Te pito o te henua\"\" has been said to be the original name of the island since French ethnologist Alphonse Pinart gave it the romantic translation \"\"the Navel of the World\"\" in his \"\"Voyage \u00e0 l'\u00cele de P\u00e2ques\"\", published in 1877.\n[5] Title: \"Easter Island\" Text:  William Churchill (1912) inquired about the phrase and was told that there were three \"\"te pito o te henua\"\", these being the three capes (land's ends) of the island. The phrase appears to have been used in the same sense as the designation of \"\"Land's End\"\" at the tip of Cornwall. He was unable to elicit a Polynesian name for the island and concluded that there may not have been one. According to Barthel (1974), oral tradition has it that the island was first named \"\"Te pito o te kainga a Hau Maka\"\", \"\"The little piece of land of Hau Maka\"\".\nQuestion: why do they call easter island easter island\nYour answer: ",

It was formed to define the financial relations between the central government of India and the individual state governments. The Finance Commission (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1951 additionally defines the terms of qualification, appointment and disqualification, the term, eligibility and powers of the Finance Commission. As per the Constitution, the Commission is appointed every five years and consists of a chairman and four other members.\n[2] Title: \"Finance Commission\" Text:  The members shall be paid salaries and allowances as per the provisions made by the Central Government. So far 14 Finance Commissions have been appointed which are as follows: Major Recommendations of 14th Finance Commission headed by Prof. Y V Reddy The Fifteenth Finance Commission was constituted by the Government of India, after the approval from the President of India, through a notification in the Gazette of India in November 2017. Nand Kishore Singh was appointed as the commission's chairman, with its full-time members being Shaktikanta Das and Anoop Singh and its part-time members being Ramesh Chand and Ashok Lahiri.\n[3] Title: \"Finance Commission\" Text:  Since the institution of the First Finance Commission, stark changes in the macroeconomic situation of the Indian economy have led to major changes in the Finance Commission's recommendations over the years. There have been fifteen commissions to date. The most recent was constituted in 2017 and is chaired by N. K.Singh, a former member of the Planning Commission. As a federal nation, India suffers from both vertical and horizontal fiscal imbalances. Vertical imbalances between the central and state governments result from states incurring expenditures disproportionate to their sources of revenue, in the process of fulfilling their responsibilities.\n[4] Title: \"Finance Commission\" Text:  The commission was set up to give recommendations for five years commencing on 1 April 2020. The main tasks of the commission were to \"\"strengthen cooperative federalism, improve the quality of public spending and help protect fiscal stability\"\". Some newspapers like \"\"The Hindu\"\" and \"\"The Economic Times\"\" noted that commission's job was harder because of the rollout of goods and service tax (GST), as, it had taken certain powers related to taxation away from states and the Union and had given it to the GST Council.\n[5] Title: \"National Finance Commission Award\" Text:  Soon, the second fifth award was announced by Prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 1997 after his rival, Benazir Bhutto, was dismissed. Although it remains conclusive on many parts, but the opposition targeted the implementation of the program. In July 2000, Finance minister Shaukat Aziz presided the convection of National Finance Commission (NFC) to finalize the sixth award, due to constitutional termination of fifth awards program. In 2001, the commission was constituted under President Pervez Musharraf to supervise the work on sixth award. Finally in 2002, the sixth NFC award under the NFC program was enacted by President Pervez Musharraf but failed to reach a consensus decision.\nQuestion: who constitutes the finance commission after every five years\nYour answer: ",

This single also reached #12 in the UK, where he is considered a one-hit wonder. Haywood is credited with writing the 1981 hit \"\"She's a Bad Mama Jama\"\" by Carl Carlton, which he produced in his own studio. In 1983, he released the album \"\"It's Me Again\"\", which featured a couple minor R&B hits.\n[2] Title: \"Carl Carlton\" Text:  He then signed with Mercury Records in 1977, but only released one single on that label. Carlton was unable to land a new recording contract for several years until Leon Haywood helped him get a singles deal with 20th Century Records. A Haywood-penned single, \"\"She's a Bad Mama Jama (She's Built, She's Stacked)\"\", became a major hit, peaking at number 2 on the soul chart and earning Carlton a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Male. in 1982.\n[3] Title: \"Carl Carlton\" Text:  The track peaked at number 34 in the UK Singles Chart. Carlton's subsequent album, \"\"Carl Carlton\"\", went gold in 1981. \"\"She's a Bad Mama Jama\"\" has since become a staple of compilation albums and soundtracks and is often sampled in rap music. Carlton released several more albums in the 1980s but had only a few minor R&B hits. After 1985's \"\"Private Property\"\", he did not release another album until 1994's \"\"Main Event\"\", which also failed to chart.\n[4] Title: \"Carl Carlton\" Text:  Carl Carlton Carl Carlton (born May 21, 1953) is an American R&B, soul, and funk singer-songwriter, best known for his hits \"\"Everlasting Love\"\" and \"\"She's a Bad Mama Jama (She's Built, She's Stacked)\"\". Carlton was born in Detroit, Michigan, and began his career in the mid-1960s as \"\"Little Carl\"\" Carlton. This was a marketing ploy to capitalize on some vocal similarities to Stevie Wonder, who recorded under the name \"\"Little Stevie Wonder\"\" in the early 1960s.\n[5] Title: \"Hideki Fujisawa\" Text:  He re-arranged famous American/British dance songs from the 70's and 80's, often replacing the lyrics with humorous lines.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Alfred the Great\" Text:  That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, W\u00e6ferth, and Wulfsige. Manuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century. Numerous Anglo-Saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them. And a solemn diploma from Christ Church, Canterbury, dated 873, is so poorly constructed and written that historian Nicholas Brooks posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote or who knew little or no Latin.\n[2] Title: \"Anglo-Saxon art\" Text:  However Anglo-Saxon society was massively disrupted in the 9th century, especially the later half, by the Viking invasions, and the number of significant objects surviving falls considerably, and their dating becomes even vaguer than of those from a century before. Most monasteries in the north were closed for decades, if not forever, and after the Canterbury Bible of before 850, perhaps well before, \"\"no major illuminated manuscript is known until well on into the tenth century\"\". King Alfred (r. 871\u2013899) held the Vikings back to a line running diagonally across the middle of England, above which they settled in the Danelaw, and were gradually integrated into what was now a unified Anglo-Saxon kingdom.\n[3] Title: Anglo-Saxons Text:  Further decorated motifs used in these manuscripts, such as hunched, triangular beasts, also appear on objects from the Trewhiddle hoard (buried in the 870s) and on the rings which bear the names of King \u00c6thelwulf and Queen \u00c6thelswith, which are the centre of a small corpus of fine ninth-century metalwork. There was demonstrable continuity in the south, even though the Danish settlement represented a watershed in England's artistic tradition. Wars and pillaging removed or destroyed much Anglo-Saxon art, while the settlement introduced new Scandinavian craftsmen and patrons. The result was to accentuate the pre-existing distinction between the art of the north and that of the south.\n[4] Title: \"Anglo-Saxon art\" Text:  It is, in the usual chronology, the last English manuscript in which \"\"developed trumpet spiral patterns\"\" are found. The 9th century, especially the latter half, has very few major survivals made in England, but was a period when Insular and Anglo-Saxon influence on Carolingian manuscripts was at its height, from scriptoria such as those at the Anglo-Saxon mission's foundation at Echternach Abbey (though the important Echternach Gospels were created in Northumbria), and the major monastery at Tours, where Alcuin of York was followed by another Anglo-Saxon abbot, between them covering the period from 796 to 834.\n[5] Title: \"Anglo-Saxon art\" Text:  Although Tours' own library was destroyed by Norsemen, over 60 9th century illuminated manuscripts from the \"\"scriptorium\"\" survive, in a style showing many borrowings from English models, especially in initial pages, where Insular influence remained visible in northern France until even the 12th century. The Anglo-Saxon metalwork produced in the Salzburg area of modern Austria has a manuscript counterpart in the \"\"Cutbercht Gospels\"\" in Vienna. By the 10th century Insular elements were relegated to decorative embellishments in England, as the first phase of the \"\"Winchester style\"\" developed.\nQuestion: what happened to many manuscripts of anglo-saxon literature\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Small intestine\" Text:  The small intestine is the site where most of the nutrients from ingested food are absorbed. The inner wall, or mucosa, of the small intestine is lined with simple columnar epithelial tissue. Structurally, the mucosa is covered in wrinkles or folds called plicae circulares, which are considered permanent features in the wall of the organ. They are distinct from rugae which are considered non-permanent or temporary allowing for distention and contraction. From the plicae circulares project microscopic finger-like pieces of tissue called villi (Latin for \"\"shaggy hair\"\").\n[2] Title: \"Small intestine\" Text:  Small intestine The small intestine or small bowel is the part of the gastrointestinal tract between the stomach and the large intestine, and is where most of the end absorption of food takes place. The small intestine has three distinct regions \u2013 the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum is the shortest part of the small intestine and is where preparation for absorption begins. It also receives bile and pancreatic juice through the pancreatic duct, controlled by the sphincter of Oddi. The primary function of the small intestine is the absorption of nutrients and minerals from food, using small finger-like protrusions called villi.\n[3] Title: \"Small intestine\" Text:  The material that remains undigested and unabsorbed passes into the large intestine. Absorption of the majority of nutrients takes place in the jejunum, with the following notable exceptions: The small intestine supports the body's immune system. The presence of gut flora appears to contribute positively to the host's immune system. Peyer's patches, located within the ileum of the small intestine, are an important part of the digestive tract's local immune system. They are part of the lymphatic system, and provide a site for antigens from potentially harmful bacteria or other microorganisms in the digestive tract to be sampled, and subsequently presented to the immune system.\n[4] Title: \"Lymphatic system\" Text:  While most other nutrients absorbed by the small intestine are passed on to the portal venous system to drain via the portal vein into the liver for processing, fats (lipids) are passed on to the lymphatic system to be transported to the blood circulation via the thoracic duct. (There are exceptions, for example medium-chain triglycerides are fatty acid esters of glycerol that passively diffuse from the GI tract to the portal system.) The enriched lymph originating in the lymphatics of the small intestine is called chyle. The nutrients that are released into the circulatory system are processed by the liver, having passed through the systemic circulation.\n[5] Title: \"Small intestine\" Text:  In traditional Chinese medicine, the small intestine is a yang organ.

In 1942, Sharma was commissioned into the 8th Battalion, 19th Hyderabad Regiment. He served in Burma during the Arakan Campaign of World War II, for which he was mentioned in despatches. He later fought in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. Sharma was martyred on 3 November 1947 while evicting Pakistani infiltrators from Srinagar Airport, and was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra for his actions prior to his death.\n[2] Title: \"Somnath Sharma\" Text:  This was the first time the honour had been awarded since its inception. Coincidentally, Savitri Khanolkar, the mother-in-law of Sharma's brother, was the designer of the Param Vir Chakra. The official citation reads: In the 1980s, the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), a Government of India enterprise under the aegis of the Ministry of Shipping, named fifteen of their crude oil tankers in honour of the Param Vir Chakra recipients. The crude oil tanker named MT \"\"Major Somnath Sharma, PVC\"\" was delivered to SCI on 11 June 1984.\n[3] Title: \"Param Vir Chakra\" Text:  Nehru entrusted the implementation of the PVC to Major General Hira Lal Atal, the first Indian adjutant general of India. He in turn requested Savitri Khanolkar, the wife of an Indian Army officer, Vikram Khanolkar of the Sikh Regiment, to design the medal for the PVC. Coincidentally, the first PVC would be awarded to Major Somnath Sharma, the brother-in-law of Khanolkar's daughter. Despite gaining independence from British rule, India still remained a dominion of the United Kingdom. This meant that the Governor-General of India could not approve the establishment of the awards without assent from the British Crown.\n[4] Title: \"Param Vir Chakra\" Text:  During the First World War, the British awards system was adopted and continued through the Second World War. Post-independence, new awards were instituted on 26January 1950, with retroactive effect from 15August 1947. Param Vir Chakra translates as the \"\"Wheel of the Ultimate Brave\"\", and the award is granted for \"\"most conspicuous bravery in the presence of the enemy\"\". The medal of the PVC was designed by Savitri Khanolkar, whose daughter's brother-in-law, Major Somnath Sharma, was coincidentally awarded the first PVC.\n[5] Title: \"Somnath Sharma\" Text:  The tanker was phased out after 25 years service. The first episode of the TV series on the lives of Param Vir Chakra winners, \"\"Param Vir Chakra\"\" (1988) covered Sharma's actions of 3 November 1947. In that episode, his part was played by Farooque Sheikh. The episode was directed by Chetan Anand.

It can be found on his albums \"\"Songs & More Songs by Tom Lehrer\"\" as well as \"\"An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer\"\". The song is sung to the tune of Sir Arthur Sullivan's \"\"Major General's Song\"\" (\"\"I am the very model of a modern major-general...\"\") from \"\"The Pirates of Penzance\"\".\n[3] Title: \"The Elements (song)\" Text:  Lehrer did not normally speak with that accent. Lehrer accompanied himself on the piano while singing the song. Lehrer drew the inspiration for \"\"The Elements\"\" from the song \"\"Tchaikovsky and Other Russians\"\", written by Ira Gershwin, which listed fifty Russian composers in a similar manner. \"\"The Elements\"\" differs from the \"\"Major-General's Song\"\" in that: \"\"The Elements\"\" has been featured in popular culture many times. In the episode \"\"Ex-File\"\" of \"\"NCIS\"\", Timothy McGee and Abby Sciuto hum the song, which forms a key clue in their case.\n[4] Title: \"Tom Lehrer\" Text:  (by Cole Porter) made an early and lasting impression on him. Lehrer's style consists of parodying various forms of popular song. For example, his appreciation of list songs led him to write \"\"The Elements\"\", which lists the chemical elements to the tune of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"\"Major-General's Song\"\". In author Isaac Asimov's second autobiographical volume \"\"In Joy Still Felt\"\", Asimov recounted seeing Lehrer perform in a Boston nightclub on October 9, 1954. Lehrer sang cleverly about Jim getting it from Louise, and Sally from Jim, \"\"...and after a while you gathered the 'it' was venereal disease [the song was likely \"\"I Got It From Sally\"\" (in later versions \"\"Agnes\"\")].\n[5] Title: \"Tom Lehrer\" Text:  Tom Lehrer Thomas Andrew Lehrer (; born April 9, 1928) is a retired American musician, singer-songwriter, satirist, and mathematician. He has lectured on mathematics and musical theater. He is best known for the pithy, humorous songs he recorded in the 1950s and 1960s. Lehrer\u2019s work often parodied popular song forms, though he usually created original melodies when doing so.

The Dodgers would not make another World Series appearance until 2017, where they would lose in seven games against the Houston Astros, who won their very first World Series title. The Dodgers would make another World Series appearance the following year in 2018, but lost to the Boston Red Sox in five games, marking the first time the Dodgers lost back-to-back World Series since 1977 and 1978, where they lost both World Series to the New York Yankees.\n[2] Title: \"1981 World Series\" Text:  1981 World Series The 1981 World Series was the championship series of the 1981 MLB season. It matched the New York Yankees against the Los Angeles Dodgers, marking their third meeting in the Series in five years as well as a record eleventh Series meeting overall and last Series meeting to date. The Dodgers won the Series in six games in a mirror image of the two teams' last Series meeting in , for their first title since and their first victory over the Yankees since and third World Series win over the Yankees, overall.\n[3] Title: \"1981 World Series\" Text:  This is the last World Series that a team won after losing the first two games on the road. This also was the last meeting between teams from New York City and Los Angeles for a major professional sports championship until the Los Angeles Kings and New York Rangers reached the NHL's 2014 Stanley Cup Finals, and also the last meeting between the Dodgers and the Yankees in the World Series to date (the two teams have met 11 times in the World Series, making it the most frequent matchup in World Series history).\n[4] Title: \"Los Angeles Dodgers\" Text:  Although the rivalry's significance arose from the two teams' numerous World Series meetings, the Yankees and Dodgers have not met in the World Series since . They would not play each other in a non-exhibition game until 2004, when they played a three-game interleague series. Their last meeting was in September 2016, when the Dodgers won two out of three games in New York. The Dodgers have a loyal fanbase, evidenced by the fact that the Dodgers were the first MLB team to attract more than 3 million fans in a season (in 1978), and accomplished that feat six more times before any other franchise did it once.\n[5] Title: \"Dodgers\u2013Yankees rivalry\" Text:  Lasorda said of the revenge for what Jackson did to the Dodgers in 1977 and 1978: \"\"We were suffering and the guy was making a fool out of us.

Hutton's work established geology as a science, and as a result he is referred to as the \"\"Father of Modern Geology\"\". Through observation and carefully reasoned geological arguments, Hutton came to believe that the Earth was perpetually being formed; he recognised that the history of Earth could be determined by understanding how processes such as erosion and sedimentation work in the present day.\n[3] Title: Uniformitarianism Text:  Coined by William Whewell, the word was proposed in contrast to catastrophism by British naturalists in the late 18th century, starting with the work of the geologist James Hutton in his many books including \"\"Theory of the Earth\"\". Hutton's work was later refined by scientist John Playfair and popularised by geologist Charles Lyell's \"\"Principles of Geology\"\" in 1830. Today, Earth's history is considered to have been a slow, gradual process, punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events. The earlier conceptions likely had little influence on 18th-century European geological explanations for the formation of Earth.\n[4] Title: Uniformitarianism Text:  Abraham Gottlob Werner (1749\u20131817) proposed Neptunism, where strata represented deposits from shrinking seas precipitated onto primordial rocks such as granite. In 1785 James Hutton proposed an opposing, self-maintaining infinite cycle based on natural history and not on the Biblical account. Hutton then sought evidence to support his idea that there must have been repeated cycles, each involving deposition on the seabed, uplift with tilting and erosion, and then moving undersea again for further layers to be deposited. At Glen Tilt in the Cairngorm mountains he found granite penetrating metamorphic schists, in a way which indicated to him that the presumed primordial rock had been molten after the strata had formed.\n[5] Title: \"Historical geology\" Text:  James Hutton and Charles Lyell also contributed to early understanding of the Earth's history with their observations at Edinburgh in Scotland concerning angular unconformity in a rock face and it was in fact Lyell that influenced Charles Darwin greatly in his theory of evolution by speculating that the present is the key to the past. Hutton first proposed the theory of uniformitarianism, which is now a basic principle in all branches of geology. Hutton also supported the idea that the Earth was very old as opposed to the prevailing concept of the time which said the Earth had only been around a few millennia.\nQuestion: what scientists is credited with proposing the principle of uniformitarianism\nYour answer: ",

It released as the album's first single in December 1976 on both sides of the Atlantic. Written and sung by Lindsey Buckingham, it became the band's first top ten hit in the United States. The album spawned three additional top ten hits, including the band's sole number one hit, \"\"Dreams\"\". \"\"Rumours\"\" would go on to sell over 40 million units worldwide, 20 million of which were from the US alone.\n[2] Title: \"Go Your Own Way\" Text:  Producer/engineer Richard Dashut argued that they would not have encountered this \"\"lucky mistake\"\" had they mixed the song digitally. Other overdubs include a Hammond B3 organ, several electric and acoustic guitars, layered backing vocals, and assorted percussion. Like most tracks on \"\"Rumours\"\", the lyrical content of \"\"Go Your Own Way\"\" documents personal strain in relationships between other band members. Buckingham had written this as a response to his breakup with fellow Fleetwood Mac vocalist Stevie Nicks, who he knew since he was sixteen years old.\n[3] Title: \"Go Your Own Way\" Text:  Recorded in three separate studios, the track was developed over a period of four months. Like most tracks off Rumours, none of the instruments were recorded live together; the tracks were instead arranged through a series of overdubs. Lyrically, \"\"Go Your Own Way\"\" is a breakup song, specifically directed at his bandmate and former lover, Stevie Nicks. \"\"Go Your Own Way\"\" has been well received by music critics, and is regarded by \"\"Rolling Stone\"\" as one of the greatest rock songs of all time.\n[4] Title: \"Go Your Own Way\" Text:  \"\"All of these factors, plus a great performance from the band (especially Buckingham's exquisite guitar solo) helped make the song one of the band's biggest and most timeless hits, ever.\"\" It is ranked No. 120 on \"\"Rolling Stone\"\"s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and is on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list. \"\"Rolling Stone\"\" also ranked it #1 on its list of Fleetwood Mac's 50 Greatest Songs.\n[5] Title: \"Go Your Own Way\" Text:  Mick wasn't so sure he could do what Lindsey wanted, but he did a great job, and the song took off.\"\" Fleetwood would ultimately come up with his own variation of the \"\"Street Fighting Man\"\" groove, where he played across the tom-toms while letting the bass drum play the middle beat. Initially, John McVie's bass part was much more bouncy, and gave the song more of a country feel. Much to McVie's dissappointment, Buckingham asked him to instead play straight eighth notes on the verses, but allowed him to open up with a more melodic bassline on the chorus.\nQuestion: who sings vocals on go your own way\nYour answer: ",

Captain America was the first Marvel Comics character to appear in media outside comics with the release of the 1944 movie serial, \"\"Captain America\"\".

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Pepsin Text:  Pepsin is an aspartic protease, using a catalytic aspartate in its active site. It is one of three principal proteases in the human digestive system, the other two being chymotrypsin and trypsin. During the process of digestion, these enzymes, each of which is specialized in severing links between particular types of amino acids, collaborate to break down dietary proteins into their components, i.e., peptides and amino acids, which can be readily absorbed by the small intestine. Pepsin is most efficient in cleaving peptide bonds between hydrophobic and preferably aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine.\n[2] Title: \"Aspartic protease\" Text:  The MEROPS classification systematic names these clans alphabetically. Many eukaryotic aspartic endopeptidases (MEROPS peptidase family A1) are synthesised with signal and propeptides. The animal pepsin-like endopeptidase propeptides form a distinct family of propeptides, which contain a conserved motif approximately 30 residues long. In pepsinogen A, the first 11 residues of the mature pepsin sequence are displaced by residues of the propeptide. The propeptide contains two helices that block the active site cleft, in particular the conserved Asp11 residue, in pepsin, hydrogen bonds to a conserved Arg residue in the propeptide.\n[3] Title: \"Aspartic protease\" Text:  This hydrogen bond stabilises the propeptide conformation and is probably responsible for triggering the conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin under acidic conditions.

Aspartic endopeptidases of vertebrate, fungal and retroviral origin have been characterised. More recently, aspartic endopeptidases associated with the processing of bacterial type 4 prepilin and archaean preflagellin have been described. Eukaryotic aspartic proteases include pepsins, cathepsins, and renins.\n[5] Title: Pepsin Text:  Pepsin Pepsin is an endopeptidase that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides (that is, a protease). It is produced in the stomach and is one of the main digestive enzymes in the digestive systems of humans and many other animals, where it helps digest the proteins in food. Pepsin has a three-dimensional structure, of which one or more polypeptide chains twist and fold, bringing together a small number of amino acids to form the active site, or the location on the enzyme where the substrate binds and the reaction takes place.\nQuestion: based on the residues in the active site what family of proteases does pepsin belong to\nYour answer: ",

Singer Kelly Jones shared in the vocals with Jones. The video featured an appearance by Welsh actor Rhys Ifans. P. J. Proby recorded one of the earliest versions of the song in 1967, followed by Three Dog Night's 1970 hit. Also in 1970, American singer/songwriter Odetta covered the song on her album \"\"Odetta Sings\"\". It has also been recorded by a diverse range of artists, including Wilson Pickett, Lou Rawls, The Wolfgang Press, Yo La Tengo, The Slackers, and Paul Frees (as W.C.

Three Dog Night's 1970 cover of the song topped the US pop singles chart. Tom Jones and the Stereophonics' cover version also hit number four on the UK Singles Chart in 2000. Newman says that the song was inspired by his own lighthearted reflection on the Los Angeles music scene of the late 1960s. As with most Newman songs, he assumes a character - in \"\"Mama...\"\" the narrator is a sheltered and extraordinarily straight-laced young man, who recounts what is presumably his first \"\"wild\"\" party in the big city, is shocked and appalled by marijuana smoking, whiskey drinking, and loud music and \u2014 in the chorus of the song \u2014 recalls his \"\"mama told [him] not to come.\"\"\n[3] Title: \"Mama Told Me Not to Come\" Text:  Also used in the movie \"\"The Sweetest Thing\"\" (2002), when Cameron Diaz is walking up the street, and in \"\"Joy\"\" (2015) it's performed by cast members in a scene set in a music class .

A scheduled single-release of September 1966 was withdrawn, but the song was eventually included on their 1967 album \"\"Eric Is Here\"\". Newman's own version of his song was released on the 1970 album \"\"12 Songs\"\", and was characterized by Newman's midtempo piano accompaniment, as well as Ry Cooder's slide guitar part, both of which give the song the feel of a bluesy Ray Charles-style rhythm and blues number.\n[5] Title: \"Nilsson Sings Newman\" Text:  The song \"\"Mama Told Me Not to Come\"\", written four years earlier for Eric Burdon, was delivered in stripped-down form, and helped Newman establish himself as a composer of note. Newman appeared in solo engagements beginning in June 1970 on an NBC TV special hosted by Liza Minnelli. \"\"Mama Told Me Not to Come\"\" yielded a #1 chart topper for Three Dog Night in July 1970.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: HTTPS Text:  This ensures reasonable protection from eavesdroppers and man-in-the-middle attacks, provided that adequate cipher suites are used and that the server certificate is verified and trusted. Because HTTPS piggybacks HTTP entirely on top of TLS, the entirety of the underlying HTTP protocol can be encrypted. This includes the request URL (which particular web page was requested), query parameters, headers, and cookies (which often contain identity information about the user). However, because host (website) addresses and port numbers are necessarily part of the underlying TCP/IP protocols, HTTPS cannot protect their disclosure.\n[2] Title: HTTPS Text:  HTTP operates at the highest layer of the TCP/IP model, the Application layer; as does the TLS security protocol (operating as a lower sublayer of the same layer), which encrypts an HTTP message prior to transmission and decrypts a message upon arrival. Strictly speaking, HTTPS is not a separate protocol, but refers to use of ordinary HTTP over an encrypted SSL/TLS connection. HTTPS encrypts all message contents, including the HTTP headers and the request/response data. With the exception of the possible CCA cryptographic attack described in the limitations section below, an attacker should only be able to discover that a connection is taking place between the two parties and their domain names and IP addresses.\n[3] Title: HTTPS Text:  HTTPS Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS), or, formerly, its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also often referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL. The principal motivation for HTTPS is authentication of the accessed website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit.\n[4] Title: HTTPS Text:  Netscape Communications created HTTPS in 1994 for its Netscape Navigator web browser. Originally, HTTPS was used with the SSL protocol. As SSL evolved into Transport Layer Security (TLS), HTTPS was formally specified by RFC 2818 in May 2000. HTTPS Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS), or, formerly, its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).\n[5] Title: HTTPS Text:  Similarly, cookies on a site served through HTTPS have to have the secure attribute enabled. HTTPS URLs begin with \"\"https://\"\" and use port 443 by default, whereas HTTP URLs begin with \"\"http://\"\" and use port 80 by default. HTTP is not encrypted and is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks, which can let attackers gain access to website accounts and sensitive information, and modify webpages to inject malware or advertisements.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Inca society\" Text:  Inca government is generally seen as an omnipotent emperor that ruled over a bureaucracy made up of local elites who had been recruited to serve in the state. This style of rule is often credited to Cuzco's success. The Inca empire was adamant about expansion and did so through two imperialism strategies: territorial administration and indirect-hegemonic control. Territorial administration consisted of a complete take over of provinces by reorganizing the economy through increased agricultural production and control of exchange routes via the Incan road system. The territorial administration allowed the Inca empire to put in a great deal of effort to control a new territory in hopes to strengthen the empire by a flow of surplus goods back to the empire core from the overtaken province.\n[2] Title: \"Economy of Peru\" Text:  The Inca Empire, was organized in dominions with a stratified society, in which the ruler was the Inca. It was also supported by an economy based on the collective property of the land. In fact, the Inca Empire was conceived like an ambitious and audacious civilizing project, based on a mythical thought, in which the harmony of the relationships between the human being, nature, and gods was truly essential. The economy was mainly agricultural, though it reached some animal husbandry and mining development. The primary goal of the Incan economy was substinence, with a system based on reciprocity and exchange of products.\n[3] Title: \"Economic history of Peru\" Text:  The Tahuantinsuyo was organized in dominions with a stratified society, in which the ruler was the Inca. It was also supported by an economy based on the collective property of the land.

The economy was mainly agricultural, though it reached some animal husbandry and mining development. The primary goal of the Incan economy was substinence, with a system based on reciprocity and exchange of products The colonial economy was dominated by mineral wealth, and labor was initially provided through enslavement of the indigenous peoples.\n[4] Title: \"Inca Empire\" Text:  The Incas considered their king, the Sapa Inca, to be the \"\"son of the sun.\"\" The Inca Empire was unique in that it lacked many features associated with civilization in the Old World. In the words of one scholar, The Incan economy has been described in contradictory ways by scholars: The Inca empire functioned largely without money and without markets. Instead, exchange of goods and services was based on reciprocity between individuals and among individuals, groups, and Inca rulers. \"\"Taxes\"\" consisted of a labour obligation of a person to the Empire.\n[5] Title: \"Inca Empire\" Text:  In return, the state provided security, food in times of hardship through the supply of emergency resources, agricultural projects (e.g. aqueducts and terraces) to increase productivity and occasional feasts. The economy rested on the material foundations of the vertical archipelago, a system of ecological complementarity in accessing resources and the cultural foundation of \"\"ayni\"\", or reciprocal exchange.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"History of mobile phones\" Text:  The latter meant that the average distance transmission from phone to the base station shortened, leading to increased battery life while on the move. The second generation introduced a new variant of communication called SMS or text messaging. It was initially available only on GSM networks but spread eventually on all digital networks. The first machine-generated SMS message was sent in the UK on 3 December 1992 followed in 1993 by the first person-to-person SMS sent in Finland. The advent of prepaid services in the late 1990s soon made SMS the communication method of choice among the young, a trend which spread across all ages.\n[2] Title: \"Text messaging\" Text:  Modern SMS text messaging is usually messaging from one mobile phone to another. Finnish Radiolinja became the first network to offer a commercial person-to-person SMS text messaging service in 1994. When Radiolinja's domestic competitor, Telecom Finland (now part of TeliaSonera) also launched SMS text messaging in 1995 and the two networks offered cross-network SMS functionality, Finland became the first nation where SMS text messaging was offered on a competitive as well as on a commercial basis. GSM was allowed in the United States and the radio frequencies were blocked and awarded to US \"\"Carriers\"\" to use US technology.\n[3] Title: SMS Text:  All first installations of SMS gateways were for network notifications sent to mobile phones, usually to inform of voice mail messages. The first commercially sold SMS service was offered to consumers, as a person-to-person text messaging service by Radiolinja (now part of Elisa) in Finland in 1993. Most early GSM mobile phone handsets did not support the ability to send SMS text messages, and Nokia was the only handset manufacturer whose total GSM phone line in 1993 supported user-sending of SMS text messages. According to Matti Makkonen, the inventor of SMS text messages, Nokia 2010, which was released in January 1994, was the first mobile phone to support composing SMSes easily.\n[4] Title: \"Text messaging\" Text:  This was part of ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) and since GSM is based on this, made its way to the mobile phone. Messages could be sent and received on ISDN phones, and these can send SMS to any GSM phone. The possibility of doing something is one thing, implementing it another, but systems existed from 1988 that sent SMS messages to mobile phones (compare ND-NOTIS). SMS messaging was used for the first time on 3 December 1992, when Neil Papworth, a 22-year-old test engineer for Sema Group in the UK (now Airwide Solutions), used a personal computer to send the text message \"\"Merry Christmas\"\" via the Vodafone network to the phone of Richard Jarvis, who was at a party in Newbury, Berkshire, which had been organised to celebrate the event.\n[5] Title: GSM Text:  The following year saw the sending of the first short messaging service (SMS or \"\"text message\"\") message, and Vodafone UK and Telecom Finland signed the first international roaming agreement. Work began in 1991 to expand the GSM standard to the 1800 MHz frequency band and the first 1800 MHz network became operational in the UK by 1993, called and DCS 1800. Also that year, Telecom Australia became the first network operator to deploy a GSM network outside Europe and the first practical hand-held GSM mobile phone became available.\nQuestion: when did texting become available on cell phones\nYour answer: ",

In 1961, Boston University and Dartmouth played one game with an experimental rule that counted all field goals as three points. At the direction of Abe Saperstein, the American Basketball League became the first basketball league to institute the rule in 1961. Its three-point line was a radius of from the baskets, except along the sides. The Eastern Professional Basketball League followed in its 1963\u201364 season.\n[2] Title: \"Three-point field goal\" Text:  The NCAA adopted the three-pointer in women's basketball on an experimental basis for that season at the same distance, and made its use mandatory beginning In 2007, the NCAA lengthened the men's distance by a foot to , effective with the season, and the women's line was moved to match the men's in 2011\u201312. American high schools, along with elementary and middle schools, adopted a line nationally in 1987, a year after the NCAA. The NCAA used the FIBA three-point line (see below) in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) For three seasons beginning in 1994\u201395, the NBA attempted to address decreased scoring by shortening the distance of the line from ( at the corners) to a uniform around the basket.\n[3] Title: \"Three-point field goal\" Text:  The NCAA's Southern Conference became the first collegiate conference to use the three-point rule, adopting a line for the 1980\u201381 season. Ronnie Carr of Western Carolina was the first to score a three-point field goal in college basketball history on November 29, 1980. Over the following five years, NCAA conferences differed in their use of the rule and distance required for a three-pointer. The line was as close as in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), and as far away as in the Used only in conference play for several years, it was adopted by the NCAA in April 1986 for the 1986\u201387 season at and was first used in the NCAA Tournament in March 1987.\n[4] Title: \"Three-point field goal\" Text:  Chris Ford of the Boston Celtics is widely credited with making the first three-point shot in NBA history on October 12, 1979; the season opener at Boston Garden was more noted for the debut of Larry Bird (and two new Rick Barry of the Houston Rockets, in his final season, also made one in the same game, and Kevin Grevey of the Washington Bullets made one that Friday night The sport's international governing body, FIBA, introduced the three-point line in 1984, and it made its Olympic debut in 1988 in Seoul, South Korea.\n[5] Title: \"Chris Ford\" Text:  Chris Ford Christopher Joseph Ford (born January 11, 1949) is an American former professional basketball player and head coach.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" Text:  Clarice's flirtation inspires Rudolph to perform better than all of his peers at flying, but in his excitement he knocks the black cover off his nose, revealing a red glow that causes Fireball and the others to turn against him; this distraction, in turn, prompts the coach (Comet) to ban Rudolph from the Reindeer Games. Clarice remains loyal to him, only to be ordered by her father not to shame the family by associating with \"\"a red-nosed reindeer.\"\" Rudolph soon runs into Hermey, an elf who was forced out of his job at the North Pole's toy factory; Hermey showed a total lack of interest in the toymaking and singing aspects of being an elf and instead wanted to pursue dentistry.\n[2] Title: \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" Text:  This re-telling chronicles Rudolph's social rejection among his peers and his decision to run away from home. Rudolph is accompanied by a similarly outcast elf named Hermey, who skipped elf practice to become a dentist, along with a loud, boisterous, eager prospector named Yukon Cornelius who was in search of wealth. Additional original characters include Rudolph's love interest, Clarice; the antagonistic \"\"Abominable Snow Monster\"\"; and, as narrator, Sam the living Snowman, voiced by Burl Ives. In the 1964 stop-motion movie, Rudolph is born to Donner the Reindeer and Donner's wife.\n[3] Title: \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)\" Text:  However, while celebrating with the other bucks, Rudolph's fake nose pops off, causing the other reindeer to mock him and the coach to expel him. He then meets Hermey, an elf who ran away from Santa's workshop because he wanted to be a dentist instead of making toys, so they run away together. They then meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius, who has searched his whole life long to find silver and gold, but never does. After escaping the Abominable Snow Monster of the North, they crash land on the Island of Misfit Toys where unloved or unwanted toys live with their ruler, a winged lion named King Moonracer who brings the toys to the island until he can find homes and children who will love them.\n[4] Title: \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)\" Text:  Rudolph tries to save Clarice, but the monster hits him in the head with a stalactite. A few minutes later, Hermey and Yukon return and try to save Rudolph. Hermey, oinking like a pig, lures the monster out of the cave and pulls out all his teeth after Yukon knocks him out. Yukon then drives the toothless monster back, only to fall over the cliff. Mourning Yukon's presumed death, Rudolph, Hermey, Clarice, and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them. After hearing their story, Santa promises Rudolph that he will find homes for the Misfit Toys, the Head Elf tells Hermey that he can open his own dentist's office a week after Christmas, and Donner apologizes for being hard on Rudolph.\n[5] Title: \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" Text:  (1998) is an animated feature film. It received only a limited theatrical release before debuting on home video. Its inclusion of a villain, a love interest, a sidekick, and a strong protector are more derivative of the Rankin/Bass adaptation of the story than the original tale and song (the characters of Stormella, Zoey, Arrow, Slyly, and Leonard parallel the Rankin/Bass characters of the Bumble, Clarice, Fireball, Hermey, and Yukon, respectively). The movie amplifies the early backstory of Rudolph's harassment by his schoolmates (primarily his cousin Arrow) during his formative years.\nQuestion: the elf in rudolph the red nosed reindeer\nYour answer: ",

Central Queensland's major generating facilities, including the Stanwell, Gladstone and Callide power stations, produce the majority of the State's power. Queensland's newest and most technologically advanced powerhouse at Stanwell, west of the city, came on line in 1993. The Stanwell facility is a key element in the State's program to expand electricity supply and is a major exporter of power station technology.\n[2] Title: Rockhampton Text:  During the Second World War, a US army base was established outside the city; it hosted up to 70,000 servicemen en route to action in the Pacific and New Guinea. On 2 March 1949, Rockhampton was severely damaged by a cyclone. The Fitzroy River Barrage was commissioned in 1971. The barrage has a capacity of 81,300 megalitres and holds back a lake long. The barrage was funded by the Rockhampton City Council to provide a reliable source of water to the city, and to effectively drought proof Rockhampton. In 2002, a study showed that salinity was increasing in the Fitzroy Basin and, while only small areas of land were severely affected by salinity, urged that steps be taken to manage salinity by good irrigation practices and better management of tree clearing.\n[3] Title: \"Fitzroy River (Queensland)\" Text:  In the main Fitzroy River sub-catchment the only reservoirs are the Eden Bann Weir and the Fitzroy River Barrage, with the latter capable of holding when full, to provide potable water to Rockhampton city and surrounds. The Fairbairn Dam on the Nogoa River and several weirs downstream on the Mackenzie River provide water for irrigating a wide range of crops including cotton, peanuts, chickpea, corn and horticulture including citrus, table grapes, melons, supplying water for coal mines and domestic use for the town of . The traditional owners of the area in the Fitzroy River catchment are the Darumbal people, notably the Baiali and Jetimarala clans.\n[4] Title: Rockhampton Text:  It is Australia's twelfth busiest domestic airport. The airport handles flights to major Australian cities, tourist destinations, and regional destinations throughout Central Queensland. It is an important base for general aviation serving the Central Highlands and Capricorn Coast communities. The airport is also a base for the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the Rescue Helicopter. The catchment area of the Fitzroy River is approximately 145,000 square kilometres (almost the size of England). It contains six major rivers, and Rockhampton and Central Queensland accordingly enjoy abundant good water. The existing and future dams under construction ensure on-going needs for agriculture, industry and domestic purposes are met.\n[5] Title: \"Fitzroy River (Queensland)\" Text:  The river was named by European colonial settlers and pastoralists, Charles and William Archer, on 4 May 1853 in honour of Sir Charles FitzRoy, at the time the Governor of the Colony of New South Wales, as Queensland did not become a separate colony until 1859. The famous boatbuilder Colin Archer was the first to sail up the river, with his cutter \"\"Ellida\"\". The city of Rockhampton is situated on the river, some from the coast. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the city was a major port, however rocky bars in the river prevented the Fitzroy from being used for navigation any further inland.\nQuestion: where does the water in rockhampton come from\nYour answer: ",

The special now airs annually on CBS, rather than NBC, and is hailed as a classic by many. The special's original assortment of characters have acquired iconic status, and an uncertainty surrounding an error in the special's copyright has allowed the special to be widely parodied and imitated in the decades since its original airing. The success of the special led to two sequels \"\"Rudolph's Shiny New Year\"\" (premier air date December 10, 1976) which continued the reindeer's journeys, and the series was made into a trilogy with the 1979 feature-length film \"\"Christmas in July\"\", which integrated the \"\"Rudolph\"\" universe into that of Rankin/Bass's adaptation of \"\"Frosty the Snowman\"\". \"\"\"\"\nQuestion: when did rudolph 's shiny new year come out\nYour answer: ",

According to the \"\"Oxford English Dictionary\"\" middle age is between 45 and 65: \"\"The period between early adulthood and old age, usually considered as the years from about 45 to 65.\"\" The US Census lists the category middle age from 45 to 65. Merriam-Webster lists middle age from 45 to 64, while prominent psychologist Erik Erikson saw it starting a little earlier and defines middle adulthood as between 40 and 65.\n[2] Title: \"Middle age\" Text:  The \"\"Collins English Dictionary\"\" lists it between the ages of 40 and 60, and the \"\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\"\" \u2013 the standard diagnostic manual of the American Psychiatric Association \u2013 used to define middle age as 40 to 60, but as of \"\"DSM-IV (1994)\"\" revised the definition upwards to 45 to 65. This time in the lifespan is considered to be the developmental stage of those who are between 18 years old and 40 years old. Recent developmental theories have recognized that development occurs across the entire life of a person as they experience changes cognitively, physically, socially, and in personality.\n[3] Title: \"Middle age\" Text:  This time period in the life of a person can be referred to as middle age. This time span has been defined as the time between ages 45 and 65 years old. Many changes may occur between young adulthood and this stage. The body may slow down and the middle aged might become more sensitive to diet, substance abuse, stress, and rest. Chronic health problems can become an issue along with disability or disease.

Physically, the middle-aged experience a decline in muscular strength, reaction time, sensory keenness, and cardiac output. Also, women experience menopause and a sharp drop in the hormone estrogen. Men experience an equivalent endocrine system event to menopause.

In 1950 they commissioned Alabe Crafts to make a version in the form of a traditional black-and-white 8-ball. The Magic 8-Ball is a hollow plastic sphere resembling an oversized, black-and-white 8-ball. Inside, a cylindrical reservoir contains a white, plastic icosahedron floating in alcohol dyed dark blue. Each of the die's 20 faces has an affirmative, negative, or non-committal statement printed in raised letters. These messages are read through a window on the ball's bottom.\n[2] Title: \"Magic 8-Ball\" Text:  To use the ball, it must be held with the window initially facing down. After \"\"asking the ball\"\" a yes\u2013no question, the user then turns the ball so that the window faces up, setting in motion the liquid and die inside. When the die floats to the top and one face presses against the window, the raised letters displace the blue liquid to reveal the message as white letters on a blue background. Although many users shake the ball before turning it upright, the instructions warn against doing so to avoid white bubbles, which interfere with the performance of the ball itself.\n[3] Title: \"Magic 8-Ball\" Text:  Magic 8-Ball The Magic 8-Ball is a toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice, developed in the 1950s and manufactured by Mattel. The user asks a question to the large plastic ball, then turns it over to reveal a written answer which appears on the surface of the toy. An 8-ball was used as a fortune-telling device in the 1940 Three Stooges short, \"\"You Nazty Spy! \"\", and called a \"\"magic ball\"\".

In a 1917, letter from Arthur James Balfour to Lord Rothschild, known as the Balfour Declaration of 1917, the British government promised \"\"the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\"\", but at the same time required \"\"that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine\"\". In 1922, the League of Nations granted Britain a mandate for Palestine.\n[2] Title: \"Templers (religious believers)\" Text:  In April 1920 the Allies convened at the Conference of San Remo and agreed on the British rule in Palestine, followed by the official establishment of the civil administration on 1 July 1920. From that date on Keith-Roach transferred the collected rents for property in custodianship to the actual proprietors. On June 29, 1920, the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Curzon, informed the British Upper House that Great Britain agreed in principle to their return to Palestine. The League of Nations legitimised the British administration and custodianship by granting a mandate to Britain in 1922, which Turkey, the Ottoman successor, finally ratified by the Treaty of Lausanne, signed on 24 July 1923 and becoming effective on 5 August 1925.\n[3] Title: \"Partition of the Ottoman Empire\" Text:  Herbert Samuel, a former Postmaster General in the British cabinet who was instrumental in drafting the Balfour Declaration, was appointed the first High Commissioner in Palestine. In 1920 at the San Remo conference, in Italy, the League of Nations mandate over Palestine was assigned to Britain. In 1923 Britain transferred a part of the Golan Heights to the French Mandate of Syria, in exchange for the Metula region. When the Ottomans departed, the Arabs proclaimed an independent state in Damascus, but were too weak, militarily and economically, to resist the European powers for long, and Britain and France soon re-established control.\n[4] Title: \"History of Israel\" Text:  The declaration provided the British government with a pretext for claiming and governing the country. New Middle Eastern boundaries were decided by an agreement between British and French bureaucrats. The agreement gave Britain control over what parties would begin to call \"\"Palestine\"\". A Jewish Legion composed largely of Zionist volunteers organized by Jabotinsky and Trumpeldor participated in the British invasion. It also participated in the failed Gallipoli Campaign. A Zionist spy network provided the British with details of Ottoman troops. The British Mandate (in effect, British rule) of Palestine, including the Balfour Declaration, was confirmed by the League of Nations in 1922 and came into effect in 1923.\n[5] Title: \"Arab\u2013Israeli conflict\" Text:  The Arab revolt, led by T.

In 1917, Palestine was conquered by the British forces (including the Jewish Legion).

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"White Latin Americans\" Text:  Between 1877 and 1903, 1,927,992 immigrants entered Brazil, an average of 71,000 people per year, with the peak year being 1891, when 215,239 Europeans arrived. After the First World War, the Portuguese once more became the main immigrant group, and Italians fell to third place. Spanish immigrants rose to second place because of the poverty that was affecting millions of rural workers. Germans were fourth place on the list; they arrived especially during the Weimar Republic, due to poverty and unemployment caused by the First World War. The numbers of Europeans of other ethnicities increased; among them were people from Poland, Russia, and Romania, who emigrated in the 1920s, probably because of politic persecution.\n[2] Title: \"Empire of Brazil\" Text:  It is estimated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics that 500,000 Europeans immigrated to Brazil between 1808 and 1883. The figure for European settlers arriving between 1884 and 1893 climbed to 883,668. The number of Europeans immigrating continued to rise in the following decades, with 862,100 between 1894 and 1903; and 1,006,617 between 1904 and 1913. From 1872 until 1879, the nationalities forming the bulk of the new settlers were composed of Portuguese (31.2%), Italians (25.8%), Germans (8.1%) and Spanish (1.9%).\n[3] Title: \"White Latin Americans\" Text:  After independence, Brazil saw several campaigns to attract European immigrants, which were prompted by a policy of \"\"Branqueamento\"\" (Whitening). During the 19th century, the slave labor force was gradually replaced by European immigrants, especially Italians. This mostly took place after 1850, as a result of the end of the slave trade in the Atlantic Ocean and the growth of coffee plantations in the S\u00e3o Paulo region. European immigration was at its peak between the mid-19th and the mid-20th centuries, when nearly five million Europeans immigrated to Brazil, most of them Italians (58.5%), Portuguese (20%), Germans, Spaniards, Poles, Lithuanians, and Ukrainians.\n[4] Title: \"White Brazilians\" Text:  In the case of Brazil, the immigrants started arriving in huge numbers during the 1880s. From 1886 to 1900, almost 1.4 million Europeans arrived, of whom over 900,000 were Italians. During this period of 14 years, Brazil received more Europeans than during the over 300 years of colonization. According to Darcy Ribeiro before 1850 no more than 500,000 Europeans settled in Brazil IBGE estimated that the number was close to 700,000 Portuguese during the 18th century. The mass European immigration to Brazil only started in the second half of the 19th century, from 1850 to 1970 over 6 million Europeans arrived, because of three main reasons: These immigrants had a larger and more visible impact in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, along with the three southern states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paran\u00e1.\n[5] Title: \"Immigration to Brazil\" Text:  Of these, 45.73% were Portuguese, 35.74% of \"\"other nationalities\"\", 12.97% Germans, while Italians and Spanish together did not reach 6%. The total number of immigrants per year averaged 6,000. Many immigrants, particularly the Germans, were brought to settle in rural communities as small landowners. They received land, seed, livestock and other items to develop. In the last quarter of the 19th century, the entry of immigrants in Brazil grew strongly. On one hand, Europe underwent a serious demographic crisis, which resulted in increased emigration; on the other hand, the final crisis of Brazilian slavery prompted Brazilian authorities to find solutions for the problem of work force.\nQuestion: who comprised a third of brazil 's european immigrant population\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Pulmonary circulation\" Text:  The pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood to the lungs, where carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is picked up during respiration. Arteries are further divided into very fine capillaries which are extremely thin-walled. The pulmonary vein returns oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart. The oxygenated blood then leaves the lungs through pulmonary veins, which return it to the left heart, completing the pulmonary cycle. This blood then enters the left atrium, which pumps it through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. From the left ventricle, the blood passes through the aortic valve to the aorta.\n[2] Title: Blood Text:  It then enters the right ventricle and is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins. Blood then enters the left ventricle to be circulated again. Arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to all of the cells of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism by cells, to the lungs to be exhaled. However, one exception includes pulmonary arteries, which contain the most deoxygenated blood in the body, while the pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood.\n[3] Title: Heart Text:  The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion. In the left heart, oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It is then pumped into the left ventricle through the mitral valve and into the aorta through the aortic valve for systemic circulation. The aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries, arterioles, and ultimately capillaries.\n[4] Title: \"Pulmonary artery\" Text:  As a septum develops between the two ventricles of the heart, two bulges form on either side of the truncus arteriosus. These progressively enlarge until the trunk splits into the aorta and pulmonary arteries. During early development, the ductus arteriosis connects the pulmonary trunk and the aortic arch, allowing blood to bypass the lungs. The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. The blood here passes through capillaries adjacent to alveoli and becomes oxygenated as part of the process of respiration. In contrast to the \"\"pulmonary arteries\"\", the bronchial arteries supply nutrition to the lungs themselves.\n[5] Title: \"Pulmonary circulation\" Text:  The blood is then distributed to the body through the systemic circulation before returning again to the pulmonary circulation. From the right ventricle, blood is pumped through the semilunar pulmonary valve into the left and right main pulmonary arteries (one for each lung), which branch into smaller pulmonary arteries that spread throughout the lungs. The pulmonary circulation loop is virtually bypassed in fetal circulation. The fetal lungs are collapsed, and blood passes from the right atrium directly into the left atrium through the foramen ovale: an open conduit between the paired atria, or through the ductus arteriosus: a shunt between the pulmonary artery and the aorta.\nQuestion: where does the blood in the pulmonary artery go\nYour answer: ",

Beasley was born on a dog kennel in Merrimac, Wisconsin owned by Peter Curley. Beasley was later purchased along with three other dogs for production of the film and were trained by Clint Rowe, who makes a brief appearance in the film as an ASPCA officer. Beasley died in 1992, aged 14. Animal Makers created an exact replica of Hooch for the famous death scene.\n[2] Title: \"Dogue de Bordeaux\" Text:  Much later, in 1989, the typical American family saw the Dogue de Bordeaux for the first time on the big screen in Touchstone's movie \"\"Turner & Hooch\"\" about a policeman and his canine partner, although many people did not know that the massive slobbering animal was a Dogue de Bordeaux. Since then, the Dogue de Bordeaux has taken hold in the United States and can be found in greatly increasing numbers across the country. The Dogue de Bordeaux has been supported by multiple breed clubs throughout the years, and has finally found its way to full American Kennel Club recognition through the assistance of the Dogue de Bordeaux Society of America.\n[3] Title: \"Turner & Hooch\" Text:  Turner shows David around in the three days left before his transfer, meeting with long time friend Amos Reed for a final time. The two investigators are then called to the discovery of $8,000 found at the local beach - an unusual discovery for such a quiet community. That same evening, Amos is murdered by an affiliate of local seafood magnate Walter Boyett when Amos reveals his suspicions of Boyett's operations. Turner is alerted to the crime the following morning, ultimately resulting in Scott hesitantly taking in Hooch, Amos' pet Dogue de Bordeaux.\n[4] Title: \"Turner & Hooch\" Text:  However, Hyde knows that Scott is an entirely honest police officer, and calls his bluff. A wounded Hooch manages to get up, and briefly distract Hyde long enough for Scott to kill him. Realizing Hooch's wound, Scott races to Emily's clinic to save his life. However, Hooch, who lost a lot of blood, dies on the operating table, with a tearful Scott and Emily in audience. During the aftermath, Turner is made police chief while Sutton becomes leading investigator. Turner also marries Emily, with the couple now caring for Camille and her litter of puppies, one of whom looks and acts exactly like Hooch.\n[5] Title: \"Turner & Hooch\" Text:  Scott immediately takes Hooch to the new town veterinarian Emily Carson. Scott pleads with Emily to take in Hooch as he has no experience of handling such an animal before. However, Emily insists that Hooch will be good for Scott, who lives alone. Immediately returning home however, Hooch's noisy, destructive nature clashes intensely with Scott's tightly tuned routine and lifestyle. Scott leaves Hooch alone one night to buy dog food, only to return to a home that has been completely ransacked by Hooch unintentionally.

It is revealed that the murderer was indeed acting under the influence of Jacko Argyle. Jacko's carefully planned alibi failed when police could not find Calgary. The killer is revealed to be Kirsten Lindstrom, the Argyles' middle-aged housekeeper. Jacko had persuaded the plain Kirsten that he was in love with her, and persuaded her to murder his adoptive mother under cover of a \"\"foolproof\"\" alibi to steal some much needed money. But once Kirsten learned that Jacko was secretly married, she decided not to cover for Jacko, abandoning him to his fate.\n[2] Title: \"Ordeal by Innocence\" Text:  The episode guest-starred Denis Lawson as Leo, Stephanie Leonidas as Hester, Lisa Stansfield as Mary, and Jane Seymour as Rachel. This version changed considerably from the novel, such as having Jacko (Burn Gorman) executed by hanging, rather than dying in prison of natural causes. Gwenda Vaughan (Juliet Stevenson) takes Philip Durrant's (Richard Armitage) place as the household member who fatefully decides to investigate and comes too close to the truth, and is subsequently murdered by the killer, Kirsten (Alison Steadman). Omitted completely is Kirsten's attempt to silence Tina (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and Micky (Bryan Dick) by stabbing Tina.\n[3] Title: \"Ordeal by Innocence\" Text:  The script was written by Sarah Phelps, who also adapted the Christie miniseries \"\"And Then There Were None\"\" and \"\"The Witness for the Prosecution\"\" for the BBC. First scheduled to air in 2017, the series was delayed due to sexual allegations against actor Ed Westwick, who was originally cast as Mickey Argyll, which led to Westwick's scenes being reshot with Christian Cooke as Mickey. The series features many differences from the original novel, including the ending, where the killer is revealed to be Leo instead of Kirsten.\n[4] Title: \"Ordeal by Innocence\" Text:  There is also the addition of another adopted child, Bobby (Tom Riley), the twin brother of Jacko, who commits suicide after financial ruin.

The copper statue, a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States, was designed by French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886. The Statue of Liberty is a figure of Libertas, a robed Roman liberty goddess. She holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a \"\"tabula ansata\"\" inscribed in Roman numerals with \"\"JULY IV MDCCLXXVI\"\" (July 4, 1776), the date of the U.S.\n[2] Title: \"Statue of Liberty\" Text:  The erected statue does stride over a broken chain, half-hidden by her robes and difficult to see from the ground. Bartholdi was initially uncertain of what to place in Liberty's left hand; he settled on a \"\"tabula ansata\"\", used to evoke the concept of law. Though Bartholdi greatly admired the United States Constitution, he chose to inscribe \"\"JULY IV MDCCLXXVI\"\" on the tablet, thus associating the date of the country's Declaration of Independence with the concept of liberty. Bartholdi interested his friend and mentor, architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, in the project.\n[3] Title: \"Replicas of the Statue of Liberty\" Text:  In Graz, standing between the Opera House and the NextLiberty Theater, stands a steel structure built out of steel beams, that depict the original size of the statue of liberty, before the plates of the final form were being put into place.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Electron transport chain\" Text:  The final acceptor of electrons in the electron transport chain during aerobic respiration is molecular oxygen although a variety of acceptors other than oxygen such as sulfate exist in anaerobic respiration. Electron transport chains are used for extracting energy via redox reactions from sunlight in photosynthesis or, such as in the case of the oxidation of sugars, cellular respiration. In eukaryotes, an important electron transport chain is found in the inner mitochondrial membrane where it serves as the site of oxidative phosphorylation through the action of ATP synthase. It is also found in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast in photosynthetic eukaryotes.\n[2] Title: \"Electron transport chain\" Text:  In bacteria, the electron transport chain is located in their cell membrane. In chloroplasts, light drives the conversion of water to oxygen and NADP to NADPH with transfer of H ions across chloroplast membranes. In mitochondria, it is the conversion of oxygen to water, NADH to NAD and succinate to fumarate that are required to generate the proton gradient. Electron transport chains are major sites of premature electron leakage to oxygen, generating superoxide and potentially resulting in increased oxidative stress. The electron transport chain consists of a spatially separated series of redox reactions in which electrons are transferred from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule.\n[3] Title: Thylakoid Text:  The cytochrome b6f complex is part of the thylakoid electron transport chain and couples electron transfer to the pumping of protons into the thylakoid lumen. Energetically, it is situated between the two photosystems and transfers electrons from photosystem II-plastoquinone to plastocyanin-photosystem I. The thylakoid ATP synthase is a CF1FO-ATP synthase similar to the mitochondrial ATPase. It is integrated into the thylakoid membrane with the CF1-part sticking into stroma. Thus, ATP synthesis occurs on the stromal side of the thylakoids where the ATP is needed for the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. The electron transport protein plastocyanin is present in the lumen and shuttles electrons from the cytochrome b6f protein complex to photosystem I.\n[4] Title: Thylakoid Text:  The thylakoids are the site of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. These include light-driven water oxidation and oxygen evolution, the pumping of protons across the thylakoid membranes coupled with the electron transport chain of the photosystems and cytochrome complex, and ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase utilizing the generated proton gradient. The first step in photosynthesis is the light-driven reduction (splitting) of water to provide the electrons for the photosynthetic electron transport chains as well as protons for the establishment of a proton gradient. The water-splitting reaction occurs on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane and is driven by the light energy captured by the photosystems.\n[5] Title: Photosystem Text:  Electrons and hydrogen ions are added to NADP to form NADPH. This reducing agent is transported to the Calvin cycle to react with glycerate 3-phosphate, along with ATP to form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, the basic building-block from which plants can make a variety of substances. Photosystem Photosystems are functional and structural units of protein complexes involved in photosynthesis that together carry out the primary photochemistry of photosynthesis: the absorption of light and the transfer of energy and electrons. Photosystems are found in the thylakoid membranes of plants, algae and cyanobacteria. They are located in the chloroplasts of plants and algae, and in the cytoplasmic membrane of photosynthetic bacteria.\nQuestion: where is the electron transport chain of photosynthesis located\nYour answer: ",

The books of the King James Version include the 39 books of the Old Testament, an intertestamental section containing 14 books of the Apocrypha, and the 27 books of the New Testament. It was first printed by Robert Barker, the King's Printer, and was the third translation into English approved by the English Church authorities: The first had been the \"\"Great Bible\"\", commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII (1535), and the second had been the \"\"Bishops' Bible\"\", commissioned in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1568).\n[2] Title: \"Early Modern English Bible translations\" Text:  The King James Version was first published in 1611 as a complete Bible (Herbert #309) and a New Testament (Herbert #310). Translated by 47 translators using the widest range of source texts, it became known as the \"\"Authorized Version\"\" in England and is the most widely used of the Early Modern English Bible translations. Its use has continued in some traditions up to the present. Even though modern scholarship continues to claim problems with some of the translation, it is widely admired for its style and use of language.\n[3] Title: \"Early Modern English Bible translations\" Text:  The Douai translation was updated in 1750 by Bishop Challoner and while it continued to be known as the Douai version, many consider it to be equivalent to a separate translation.

The King James Version (KJV), or Authorized Version is an English translation of the Holy Bible, commissioned for the Church of England at the behest of James I of England. First published in 1611, it has had a profound impact not only on most English translations that have followed it, but also on English literature as a whole.\n[4] Title: \"King James Version\" Text:  In Europe, the first generation of Calvinists had produced the \"\"Geneva Bible\"\" of 1560 from the original Hebrew and Greek Scriptures, which was influential in the writing of the Authorized King James Version.

The translation is noted for its \"\"majesty of style\"\", and has been described as one of the most important books in English culture and a driving force in the shaping of the English-speaking world.\n[5] Title: \"King James Version\" Text:  The newly crowned King James convened the Hampton Court Conference in 1604. That gathering proposed a new English version in response to the perceived problems of earlier translations as detected by the Puritan faction of the Church of England.

This gave him his first Super Bowl win as Executive VP/GM, to go along with the two he won as the team's quarterback. Elway married Janet Buchan, who attended Stanford University and competed on its swimming team, in 1984. They separated in 2002 and divorced in 2003.

Elway was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2004 in his first year of eligibility and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2000.\n[3] Title: \"John Elway\" Text:  Following that game in Cleveland, Elway and the Broncos lost in Super Bowl XXI to the New York Giants. After two more Super Bowl losses, the Broncos entered a period of decline; however, that ended during the 1997 season, as Elway and Denver won their first Super Bowl title by defeating the Green Bay Packers 31\u201324 in Super Bowl XXXII. The Broncos repeated as champions the following season in Super Bowl XXXIII by defeating the Atlanta Falcons 34\u201319.

In 2015, the number of cases of leprosy was about 175,000 and the number of new cases was 210,000. As of 2013, 14 countries contain 95% of the globally reported leprosy cases. Of these, India has the greatest number of cases (59%), followed by Brazil (14%) and Indonesia (8%). Although the number of cases worldwide continues to fall, pockets of high prevalence remain in certain areas such as Brazil, South Asia (India, Nepal, Bhutan), some parts of Africa (Tanzania, Madagascar, Mozambique), and the western Pacific.\n[2] Title: Leprosy Text:  Endemic countries also report the number of new cases with established disabilities at the time of detection, as an indicator of the backlog prevalence. Determination of the time of onset of the disease is, in general, unreliable, is very labor-intensive, and is seldom done in recording these statistics. Using comparative genomics, in 2005, geneticists traced the origins and worldwide distribution of leprosy from East Africa or the Near East along human migration routes. They found four strains of \"\"M. leprae\"\" with specific regional locations. Strain 1 occurs predominantly in Asia, the Pacific region, and East Africa; strain 4, in West Africa and the Caribbean; strain 3 in Europe, North Africa, and the Americas; and strain 2 only in Ethiopia, Malawi, Nepal/north India, and New Caledonia.\n[3] Title: \"Mycobacterium leprae\" Text:  The geographic occurrences of \"\"M. leprae\"\" include: Angola, Brazil, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Federated States of Micronesia, India, Kiribati, Madagascar, Nepal, Republic of Marshall Islands, and the United Republic of Tanzania. The closest relative to \"\"M. leprae\"\" is \"\"M. lepromatosis\"\". These species diverged (95% highest posterior density \u2013 ) The most recent common ancestor of the extant \"\"M. leprae\"\" strains was calculated to have lived 3,607 years ago [95% highest posterior density 2204\u20135525 years ago].\n[4] Title: \"Neglected tropical diseases\" Text:  Around 90 percent of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis occurs in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru. The only method of prevention is a vaccine that is under development and prevention of sandfly bites. Diagnosis can by made by identifying clinical signs, serological tests, or parasitological tests. Leishmaniasis can be treated with expensive medications. There were 189,018 known cases of leprosy in March 2013, and 232,857 new cases were diagnosed in 2012. It is found in Angola, Brazil, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nepal, and Tanzania.\n[5] Title: Leprosy Text:  The number of new cases was 230,000. Most new cases occur in 16 countries, with India accounting for more than half. In the past 20 years, 16 million people worldwide have been cured of leprosy. About 200 cases are reported per year in the United States. Leprosy has affected humanity for thousands of years. The disease takes its name from the Greek word (\"\"l\u00e9pr\u0101\"\"), from (\"\"lep\u00eds\"\"; \"\"scale\"\"), while the term \"\"Hansen's disease\"\" is named after the Norwegian physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen.\nQuestion: where is leprosy most commonly found in the world\nYour answer: ",

Faithfull also performed the song during a guest appearance in the episode \"\"Donkey\"\" from the fourth season of \"\"Absolutely Fabulous\"\", in which God (Faithfull) sings the song in a dream to a miserable, dieting Edina. In 2016, the Faithfull version was used in the finale of \"\"\"\". In an interview on ITV's \"\"The South Bank Show\"\" aired on 24 June 2007, Faithfull said that her interpretation was that Lucy climbs to the rooftop but gets taken away by \"\"the man who reached and offered her his hand\"\" in an ambulance (\"\"long white car\"\") to a mental hospital, and that the final lines (\"\"At the age of thirty-seven she knew she'd found forever / As she rode along through Paris with the warm wind in her hair ...\"\") are actually in her imagination at the hospital.\nQuestion: who wrote the song the ballad of lucy jordan\nYour answer: ",

She began singing at the age of 11 with her eldest brother's band. After his untimely death, she decided to pursue a career in music as a tribute. She had released a number of standards in the 1970s on the Pye record label and drew crowds at cabarets.

Recorded in Nashville, the album was a continuation of Baez' experimentation with country music, begun with the previous year's \"\"David's Album\"\". It is significant in that it was the first to include Baez' own compositions, \"\"Sweet Sir Galahad\"\" and \"\"A Song for David\"\", the former song a ballad for her younger sister Mimi Fari\u00f1a, and the latter song being for her then husband, David Harris, at the time in prison as a conscientious objector.\n[3] Title: \"One Day at a Time (album)\" Text:  (The two cuts had first appeared on Baez' 1993 boxed set \"\"Rare, Live & Classic\"\").

Originally, the story was supposed to focus on Ginny Field, who checked herself into a mental institution after her traumatic battle with Jason Voorhees in the previous film. The film would have been similar to \"\"Halloween II\"\" (1981), with Jason tracking down Ginny in the mental hospital, but the concept was abandoned when Amy Steel declined to reprise her role.\n[2] Title: \"Friday the 13th Part III\" Text:  The decision to dress Jason Voorhees in his now-signature hockey mask occurred during a lighting check on set; the film's 3-D effects supervisor Martin Sadoff was a hockey fan, and supplied a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask to Miner. Miner loved the mask, but during test shots found it was too small. Using a technique called VacuForm, makeup effects director Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, art director Terry Ballard placed new red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance.\n[3] Title: \"Jason Voorhees\" Text:  During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw a mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with.\n[4] Title: \"Jason Voorhees\" Text:  The character's physical appearance has gone through many transformations, with various special makeup effects artists making their mark on the character's design, including makeup artist Stan Winston. Tom Savini's initial design has been the basis for many of the later incarnations. The trademark hockey goalie mask did not appear until \"\"Friday the 13th Part III\"\". Since \"\"\"\", filmmakers have given Jason superhuman strength, regenerative powers, and near invulnerability. He has been seen as a sympathetic character, whose motivation for killing has been cited as being driven by the immoral actions of his victims and his own rage over having drowned as a child.\n[5] Title: \"Richard Brooker\" Text:  During filming of the series, Richard had to undergo hours of makeup work to play the role of Jason, as depicted in online photographs. According to the fan-made documentary, \"\"Friday the 13th Part III: The Memoriam Documentary\"\", Brooker was at this point in the series the fittest Jason to be played.

This was the start of a specialty critical to modern medicine, anesthesiology. In 1905, nine physicians (from Long Island, N.Y.) organized the first professional anesthesia society. In 1911, the Society expanded to 23 members and became the New York Society of Anesthetists. Over the next 25 years, involvement in anesthesia-related issues grew and attracted other interested physicians nationwide. In 1936, the Society changed its name to the American Society of Anesthetists.\n[2] Title: \"American Society of Anesthesiologists\" Text:  American Society of Anesthesiologists The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) is an educational, research and scientific association of physicians organized to raise the standards of the medical practice of anesthesiology and to improve patient care. As of 2014, the organization included more than 52,000 national and international members and has more than 100 full-time employees. Anesthesiology\u2019s roots date back to the mid-19th century. On March 30, 1842, Crawford Long, M.D. administered the first ether anesthetic for surgery and operated to remove a tumor from a patient\u2019s neck.\n[3] Title: \"American Society of Anesthesiologists\" Text:  In 1945, the organization moved to become the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). In 1960, the ASA established an Executive Office in Park Ridge, Illinois to meet growing membership and patient-care demands. In 2014, the ASA opened new headquarters in Schaumburg, Illinois. Membership is open to holders of Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degrees who are licensed practitioners and have successfully completed a training program in anesthesiology approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or American Osteopathic Association (AOA).\n[4] Title: \"California Society of Anesthesiologists\" Text:  California Society of Anesthesiologists The California Society of Anesthesiologists (CSA), Inc., is a component society of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc., in the state of California.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Environmental isotopes\" Text:  For deep waters, there are two areas where density causes waters to sink into the deep ocean. These are in the North Atlantic and the Antarctic. The deep water masses formed are North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). Deep waters are mixtures of these two waters, and understanding how waters are composed of these two water masses can tell us about how water masses move around in the deep ocean. This can be investigated with environmental isotopes, including C. C is predominantly produced in the upper atmosphere and from nuclear testing, with no major sources or sinks in the ocean.\n[2] Title: \"Thermohaline circulation\" Text:  The dense water masses that sink into the deep basins are formed in quite specific areas of the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean. In the North Atlantic, seawater at the surface of the ocean is intensely cooled by the wind and low ambient air temperatures. Wind moving over the water also produces a great deal of evaporation, leading to a decrease in temperature, called evaporative cooling related to latent heat. Evaporation removes only water molecules, resulting in an increase in the salinity of the seawater left behind, and thus an increase in the density of the water mass along with the decrease in temperature.\n[3] Title: \"Thermohaline circulation\" Text:  Driven by the density gradients this sets up the main driving force behind deep ocean currents like the deep western boundary current (DWBC). The thermohaline circulation is mainly driven by the formation of deep water masses in the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean caused by differences in temperature and salinity of the water. The great quantities of dense water sinking at high latitudes must be offset by equal quantities of water rising elsewhere. Note that cold water in polar zones sink relatively rapidly over a small area, while warm water in temperate and tropical zones rise more gradually across a much larger area.\n[4] Title: \"Atlantic Ocean\" Text:  The North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) is a complex of four water masses, two that form by deep convection in the open ocean \u2014 Classical and Upper Labrador Sea Water \u2014 and two that form from the inflow of dense water across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland sill \u2014 Denmark Strait and Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water. Along its path across Earth the composition of the NADW is affected by other water masses, especially Antarctic Bottom Water and Mediterranean Overflow Water. The NADW is fed by a flow of warm shallow water into the northern North Atlantic which is responsible for the anomalous warm climate in Europe.\n[5] Title: \"Thermohaline circulation\" Text:  Just as river valleys direct streams and rivers on the continents, the bottom topography constrains the deep and bottom water masses. Note that, unlike fresh water, seawater does not have a density maximum at 4 \u00b0C but gets denser as it cools all the way to its freezing point of approximately \u22121.8 \u00b0C. This freezing point is however a function of salinity and pressure and thus \u22121.8 \u00b0C is not a general freezing temperature for sea water (see diagram to the right). Formation and movement of the deep water masses at the North Atlantic Ocean, creates sinking water masses that fill the basin and flows very slowly into the deep abyssal plains of the Atlantic.\nQuestion: where are the two major regions where dense water masses are created\nYour answer: ",

Dell often took Curry and his younger brother Seth to his games, where they would shoot with the Hornets during warm-ups. The family briefly relocated to Toronto, where Dell finished out his career as a member of the Raptors. During this time, Curry played for the Queensway Christian College boys' basketball team, leading them to an undefeated season.\n[2] Title: \"Stephen Curry\" Text:  That same year, the Warriors broke the record for the most wins in an NBA season en route to reaching the 2016 NBA Finals, which they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Curry helped the Warriors return to the NBA Finals in 2017 and 2018, where they won back-to-back titles. Curry is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and older brother of current NBA player Seth Curry. He played college basketball for Davidson. There, he was twice named Southern Conference Player of the Year and set the all-time scoring record for both Davidson and the Southern Conference.\n[3] Title: \"Dell Curry\" Text:  In 2016 Curry was the recipient of the Bobby Jones Award at the Athletes in Action All Star Breakfast, which is held each year at the NBA All Star Weekend. Curry lives in Charlotte, North Carolina, with his wife Sonya Adams, who played volleyball at Virginia Tech, where they met; the couple have three children. His older son, Stephen, plays in the NBA for the Golden State Warriors. In 2014\u201315, Stephen won the NBA MVP award and led the Warriors to the NBA championship, and in 2015\u201316, he led his team to the highest regular season win total in NBA history with 73 wins, once again being voted league MVP.\n[4] Title: \"Stephen Curry\" Text:  During the game against the Kings, Curry was guarded by his brother Seth for the first time in their NBA careers. On January 22, he recorded his second triple-double of the season and seventh of his career with 39 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in a 122\u2013110 win over the Indiana Pacers. He made eight three-pointers in the game to reach 200 for the season, becoming the first player in NBA history to make 200 three-pointers in four straight seasons. On February 3, he made 11 three-pointers (including seven in the first quarter) and scored 51 points (including a career-high 36 points in the first half) to lead the Warriors past the Washington Wizards 134\u2013121.\n[5] Title: \"Stephen Curry\" Text:  He was also a member of Toronto 5\u20130, a club team that plays across Ontario, pitting him against fellow future NBA players Cory Joseph and Kelly Olynyk. Curry led the team to a 33\u20134 record, en route to winning the provincial championship. Following Dell's retirement, the family moved back to Charlotte and Curry enrolled at Charlotte Christian School, where he was named all-conference, all-state, and led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. Because of his father's storied career at Virginia Tech, Curry wanted to play college basketball for the Hokies, but was only offered a walk-on spot due in part to his slender 160-pound frame.\nQuestion: what team does steph curry brother play for\nYour answer: ",

This was the highest scoring game for twenty years till the fifth game of the 2017 World Series between the Houston Astros and the Los Angeles Dodgers. This back-and-forth World Series continued that way in Game 4.\n[5] Title: \"1970 World Series\" Text:  Also this was the third time in a World Series where a team leading 3\u20130 in the series would fail to complete the sweep by losing game 4 but still win game 5 to win the series. 1910 and 1937 were the others. This was the last World Series until 2017 in which both participating teams won over 100 games during the regular season.

In the third season finale, the tension comes to a head, and Abby angrily tells Ziva she has no emotions, prompting both women to slap each other. They later apologize after Tony goads them into it, and both women punch him in the arm when he jokingly suggests that they should \"\"tongue-kiss\"\" one another. By Season 4, their friendship has grown and Ziva is accepted by the rest of the team, as shown in the season's premiere \"\"Shalom\"\" where Tony and the rest of the team put their careers on the line and vow to prove Ziva's innocence before she is apprehended by the FBI for a crime she did not commit, knowing that their involvement could land them in prison.\n[2] Title: \"Ziva David\" Text:  She returns to the team at the conclusion of the episode. As the sixth season progressed, storylines shifted to Ziva's \"\"sense of homelessness\"\" and dual loyalty, climaxing at the end of the season as Tony fatally shoots her boyfriend Michael Rivkin and her apartment is bombed. Ziva, as a result, tells Gibbs that she cannot continue to work with Tony as she no longer trusts him, and Gibbs accepts this for the time being, saying that he will give her time to \"\"remember who she can trust\"\".\n[3] Title: \"Ziva David\" Text:  In the Season 9 episode \"\"Safe Harbor\"\", Ziva questions his seemingly solitude lifestyle, prompting him to respond, \"\"You're never alone when you have kids,\"\" kissing her forehead and adding, \"\"Good night, kid.\"\" When Ziva learns that her boyfriend who had proposed to her was the murderer of a Navy petty officer, Gibbs is the only one to accompany her when she confronts him and he tries to comfort Ziva very much as a father would afterwards. Ziva is depicted as having a complex family history, and, as of the tenth season, all of her immediate family is deceased: Tali, her seldom-mentioned younger sister, was killed in a terrorist attack against Israel; her mother died in an unspecified violent incident; Ziva shot and killed her half-brother to save Gibbs; and her father was shot dead in a targeted killing.\n[4] Title: \"Ziva David\" Text:  In season thirteen (\"\"Family First\"\"), Ziva's farmhouse is destroyed in a mortar attack ordered by CIA Agent Trent Kort. Although Tali is found alive, the NCIS crew are informed that Ziva is dead, though her remains are not found at the house. DiNozzo subsequently departs NCIS in order to care for their daughter, and travel to both Israel (in search of answers), and Paris (as \"\"Ziva loves Paris\"\"). Prior to the season thirteen finale, Ziva builds a strong friendship with her father's successor - Director Orli Elbaz - who later informs DiNozzo of the difficulty Ziva had faced while deciding whether to inform him of the birth of their daughter which Tony is given care of after Ziva is killed.\n[5] Title: \"Ziva David\" Text:  She evidently had a close relationship with her siblings, describing her sister as \"\"the best of us\"\" and as a person who had a great deal of compassion. In Season 10's Shell Shock (Part II), Ziva tells Tony that she goes to the opera every year on Tali's birthday, as Tali had wanted to be a singer. When Ari Haswari, her older half brother by her father, is accused of murdering Special Agent Caitlin Todd, she acts as his control officer and adamantly defends him.\nQuestion: what did tony say to ziva in hebrew in nine lives\nYour answer: ",

Bandera is located in east-central Bandera County at (29.7258, -99.0750). It is northwest of downtown San Antonio, on the Medina River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.55%, is water. As of the census of 2000, there were 957 people, 408 households, and 239 families residing in the city. The population density was .\n[2] Title: \"Great Western Cattle Trail\" Text:  The Texas Trail was used by the XIT Ranch for trail drives connecting Tascosa to Dodge City until 1885. Afterwards, the Northern Trail connected Buffalo Springs to the XIT range on Cedar Creek, 60 miles north of Miles City, Montana. The trail passed through Lamar, Colorado, Kit Carson, Colorado, and Lusk, Wyoming. That trail was used from 1886 until 1897. Over a period of 3 months, some 10,000 to 12,500 steers were moved from the Yellow Houses, at the south end of the XIT Ranch, 1000 miles north to Cedar Creek.\n[3] Title: \"Great Western Cattle Trail\" Text:  It took almost one hundred days to reach their destination. The Great Western Trail went south of and roughly parallel to the Chisholm Trail into Kansas. The cattle were taken to towns which were located on major railroads and delivered north to establish ranches. Although rail lines were built in Texas, the cattle drives continued north because of Texas rail prices, it was more profitable to trail them north. The Best Great Western Cattle Trail was first traveled by Captain John T. Lytle in 1874 when he was transporting 3,500 longhorn cattle up from Southern Texas into Nebraska.\n[4] Title: \"Great Western Cattle Trail\" Text:  Great Western Cattle Trail The Great Western Cattle Trail was used during the 19th century for movement of cattle and horses to markets in eastern and northern states. The trail was also known as the Western Trail, Fort Griffin Trail, Dodge City Trail, Northern Trail and Texas Trail. It replaced the Chisholm trail when it closed. While it wasn't as well known, it was greater in length, reaching rail-heads up in Kansas and Nebraska and carried longhorns and horses to stock open-range ranches in the Dakotas, Wyoming, Montana, and two provinces in Canada.\n[5] Title: \"Great Western Cattle Trail\" Text:  In five short years, it became one of the most traveled and famous Cattle Trails in U.S. history. Despite its popularity, traffic along the trail began to decline in 1885 due to the spreading use of barbed wire fences and the legislation calling for a quarantine of Texas cattle due to the \"\"Texas Fever\"\" - a disease spread by a parasitic tick. The last major Cattle drive up the trail was on its way to Deadwood, South Dakota in 1893. By that time there had been an estimated six to seven million cattle and one million horses that had traversed the trail.\nQuestion: where did the great western cattle trail begin and end\nYour answer: ",

Edens headed the search for the right singer-actor to play Joe, the key supporting character who sings \"\"Ol' Man River\"\", and he discovered William Warfield after reading a rave review of his performance in a New York song recital. Edens also supervised cuts to the film after it was felt by the producer and director that the original cut was too slow.\n[2] Title: \"Billing (filmmaking)\" Text:  Sometimes, he may not receive special billing even if his role is crucial. For example, the then-unknown William Warfield, who played Joe and sang \"\"Ol' Man River\"\" in the 1951 film version of \"\"Show Boat\"\", received tenth billing as if he were merely a bit player, while Paul Robeson, an established star who played the same role in the 1936 film version of the musical, received fourth billing in the 1936 film. If more than one name appears at the same time or of a similar size, then those actors are said to have \"\"equal billing,\"\" with their importance decreasing from left to right.\n[3] Title: \"William Warfield\" Text:  Footage of Warfield in \"\"Show Boat\"\" has been included in several TV shows and/or films, notably \"\"That's Entertainment!\"\". Warfield played his \"\"Show Boat\"\" role in two other productions of the musical \u2013 the 1966 Lincoln Center production, and a 1972 production in Vienna. He sang Ol' Man River in three different record albums of the show \u2013 the 1951 motion picture soundtrack album on MGM Records, a 1962 studio album featuring Barbara Cook and John Raitt on Columbia Masterworks, and the RCA Victor album made from the Lincoln Center production.\n[4] Title: \"William Warfield\" Text:  This was only slightly noticeable on the 1962 studio recording of \"\"Show Boat\"\". By the time he made the 1966 recording of the Lincoln Center production of the musical, his voice had deepened from merely bass-baritone to a full-fledged bass, and he could not sing the climactic high note on \"\"Ol' Man River\"\" as easily as he had in the 1951 film version, though he sounded fine on his lower notes. Because of this problem, however, he compensated by learning how to sing even more expressively than he had before.\n[5] Title: \"Jules Bledsoe\" Text:  Bledsoe also performed the title character in Mussorgsky's \"\"Boris Godunov\"\". Bledsoe's only recording of \"\"Ol' Man River\"\", which he sang in the original production of \"\"Show Boat\"\", is occasionally played on the NPR musical theatre program, \"\"A Night on the Town\"\". His rendition of the song, especially in comparison to those made famous by Paul Robeson, William Warfield (in the 1951 film version), Bruce Hubbard (on the 1988 three-disc EMI album), and Michel Bell (in the Harold Prince revival of the show), is somewhat melodramatic in the manner of early twentieth-century acting, and Bledsoe rolls all of his \"\"r\"\"'s, as a baritone might when singing his solos in an oratorio.\nQuestion: who sang ol man river in showboat 1951\nYour answer: ",

Company rule in India effectively began in 1757 and lasted until 1858, when, following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown's assuming direct control of the Indian subcontinent in the form of the new British Raj. Despite frequent government intervention, the company had recurring problems with its finances. It was dissolved in 1874 as a result of the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act passed one year earlier, as the Government of India Act had by then rendered it vestigial, powerless, and obsolete.\n[2] Title: \"Indian Rebellion of 1857\" Text:  The rebellion saw the end of the East India Company's rule in India. In August, by the Government of India Act 1858, the company was formally dissolved and its ruling powers over India were transferred to the British Crown. A new British government department, the India Office, was created to handle the governance of India, and its head, the Secretary of State for India, was entrusted with formulating Indian policy. The Governor-General of India gained a new title, Viceroy of India, and implemented the policies devised by the India Office.\n[3] Title: \"Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad\" Text:  All the \"\"Diwan\"\" offices except the \"\"Diwan Ton\"\" were also abolished. After the Revolt of 1857, Company rule in India ended, and all the territories which were under the rule of the British East India Company came under the British Crown in 1858, which marked the beginning of the British Raj. And administrative control of India came under the Indian Civil Service, which had administrative control over all areas in India, except the Princely States.

The end of his reign marked the start of British East India Company rule over Bengal and later almost all of the Indian subcontinent. Siraj succeeded his maternal grandfather, Alivardi Khan as the Nawab of Bengal in April 1756 at the age of 23.

There has been a recent incident where a 21-year-old American student named Otto Warmbier was arrested at the airport before departure, allegedly for removing a propaganda poster from a wall in his hotel. Warmbier was at the time traveling with Chinese tour operator Young Pioneer Tours for a 5-day tourist trip to North Korea. He was convicted of \"\"committing hostile acts\"\" against the state (after allegedly stealing a propaganda poster from the restricted floor of his hotel) and sentenced to 15 years hard labor.\n[2] Title: \"Dennis Rodman\" Text:  Rodman went on to say in the video that he wanted to bring peace and \"\"open doors between both countries.\"\" Otto Warmbier, an American student held captive in North Korea for 17 months, was released to U.S. officials the same day as Rodman's visit to North Korea. Despite the timeline of the two events, the U.S. State Department, The White House, and Rodman all flatly denied any diplomatic connection or coordination between Rodman's visit and the U.S. government. The U.S. State Department said the release of Warmbier was negotiated and secured by high level U.S. diplomats including Joseph Yun, the State Department's special envoy on North Korea.\n[3] Title: \"Mike Pence\" Text:  Prior to the opening ceremony, on February 9, Pence skipped on a dinner held by South Korean President Moon Jae-in, as he would have shared a table with North Korea's ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam. Instead, he met with four North Korean defectors in Pyeongtaek, alongside his special guest, Fred Warmbier (the father of Otto Warmbier, who was arrested in North Korea for attempted theft, and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, before returning to the U.S. in a comatose state). At the ceremony, the Pences were seated in front of the North Korean delegates, and when North and South Korean athletes entered during the Parade of Athletes, they chose to stay seated, which prompted critics to accuse Pence of hypocrisy in regards to the NFL protests.\n[4] Title: \"2018 Winter Olympics\" Text:  The South Korean President, Moon Jae-in, at the start of the Olympics shook hands with the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and a prominent figure of the regime, Kim Yo-jong. This marked the first time since the Korean War that a member of the ruling Kim dynasty had visited South Korea. In contrast, U.S. vice president Mike Pence met with Fred Warmbier (father of Otto Warmbier, who had died after being released from captivity in North Korea) and a group of North Korean defectors in Pyeongchang. American officials said that North Korea cancelled a meeting with Pence at the last minute.\n[5] Title: \"Adam Schiff\" Text:  Schiff responded on Twitter that the President's \"\"comments and actions are beneath the dignity of the office.\"\" Schiff called North Korea \"\"one of the most brutal and despotic regimes in the world.\"\" After the death of American student Otto Warmbier who had been imprisoned during a visit to North Korea, Schiff said: \"\"The barbaric treatment of Otto Warmbier by the North Korean regime amounts to the murder of a U.S. citizen.\"\" In April 2018, asked whether he thought Trump deserved at least partial credit for North Korea\u2019s involvement in talks with the US, Schiff responded: \u201cI think it\u2019s more than fair to say that the combination of the president\u2019s unpredictability and indeed, his bellicosity had something to do with the North Koreans deciding to come to the negotiating table.\nQuestion: who did otto go with to north korea\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Analytical Engine\" Text:  Analytical Engine The Analytical Engine was a proposed mechanical general-purpose computer designed by English mathematician and computer pioneer Charles Babbage. It was first described in 1837 as the successor to Babbage's difference engine, a design for a mechanical computer. The Analytical Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete. In other words, the logical structure of the Analytical Engine was essentially the same as that which has dominated computer design in the electronic era..\n[2] Title: \"History of computer science\" Text:  Then in 1672 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz invented the Stepped Reckoner which he completed in 1694. In 1837 Charles Babbage first described his Analytical Engine which is accepted as the first design for a modern computer. The analytical engine had expandable memory, an arithmetic unit, and logic processing capabilities able to interpret a programming language with loops and conditional branching. Although never built, the design has been studied extensively and is understood to be Turing equivalent. The analytical engine would have had a memory capacity of less than 1 kilobyte of memory and a clock speed of less than 10 Hertz .\n[3] Title: \"Computer science\" Text:  Charles Babbage started the design of the first \"\"automatic mechanical calculator\"\", his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first \"\"programmable mechanical calculator\"\", his Analytical Engine. He started developing this machine in 1834, and \"\"in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer\"\". \"\"A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom\"\" making it infinitely programmable.\n[4] Title: \"Charles Babbage\" Text:  The major innovation was that the Analytical Engine was to be programmed using punched cards: the Engine was intended to use loops of Jacquard's punched cards to control a mechanical calculator, which could use as input the results of preceding computations. The machine was also intended to employ several features subsequently used in modern computers, including sequential control, branching and looping. It would have been the first mechanical device to be, in principle, Turing-complete. The Engine was not a single physical machine, but rather a succession of designs that Babbage tinkered with until his death in 1871.\n[5] Title: \"Analytical Engine\" Text:  The Analytical Engine is one of the most successful achievements of Charles Babbage. Babbage was never able to complete construction of any of his machines due to conflicts with his chief engineer and inadequate funding. It was not until the late 1940s that the first general-purpose computers were actually built, more than a century after Babbage had proposed the pioneering Analytical Engine in 1837. Babbage's first attempt at a mechanical computing device, the Difference Engine, was a special-purpose machine designed to tabulate logarithms and trigonometric functions by evaluating finite differences to create approximating polynomials.\nQuestion: who developed the analytical engine which had features of present day computers\nYour answer: ",

The filming of \"\"Once Upon a Time\"\" proved to be a particularly intense experience for McKern; according to one biographer, the stress caused him to suffer either a nervous breakdown or a heart attack (accounts differ), forcing production to stop for a time.\n[5] Title: \"Once Upon a Time (TV series)\" Text:  However, Mr. Gold, with the help of Cruella De Vil (Victoria Smurfit), Maleficent (Kristin Bauer van Straten), and Ursula (Merrin Dungey), has his own plan to rewrite the rules governing the fates of all heroes and villains. Henry and Emma race to restore reality and the truth before the twisted inversion becomes permanent. However, the price leads to the ultimate sacrifice. The fifth season was announced on May 7, 2015, and premiered on September 27, 2015. It was once again split into two volumes with the first volume ran from September to December 2015, and the second volume from March to May 2016.\nQuestion: who plays baelfire in once upon a time\nYour answer: ",

He is shown to have been a student of Philoctetes and takes his advice to let Hercules travel with him. In \"\"The Heroes of Olympus\"\" story \"\"The Lost Hero,\"\" there was a reference to the mythical Jason when Jason Grace and his friends encounter Medea. Jason Jason (; Ancient Greek: \u1f38\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd \"\"I\u00e1s\u014dn\"\" ) was an ancient Greek mythological hero who was the leader of the Argonauts whose quest for the Golden Fleece featured in Greek literature.\n[2] Title: \"Percy Jackson & the Olympians\" Text:  Set a month after the events of \"\"The Last Olympian\"\" and before he goes missing in \"\"The Lost Hero\"\", Percy and Annabeth retrieve Hermes' stolen staff. One of the stories is written by Riordan's son, Haley, and revolves around one of the demigods who fought for Kronos during the Second Titan War and survived the battle in Manhattan. As a part of the spin-off \"\"The Heroes of Olympus\"\" series, \"\"The Demigod Diaries\"\" contain a story involving Jason, Leo, and Piper that recounts their time spent at Camp Half-Blood between \"\"The Lost Hero\"\" and \"\"The Son of Neptune\"\".\n[3] Title: Jason Text:  Jason Jason (; Ancient Greek: \u1f38\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd \"\"I\u00e1s\u014dn\"\" ) was an ancient Greek mythological hero who was the leader of the Argonauts whose quest for the Golden Fleece featured in Greek literature. He was the son of Aeson, the rightful king of Iolcos. He was married to the sorceress Medea. He was also the great-grandson of the messenger god Hermes, through his mother's side. Jason appeared in various literary works in the classical world of Greece and Rome, including the epic poem \"\"Argonautica\"\" and the tragedy \"\"Medea\"\".\n[4] Title: Jason Text:  Jason's son, Thessalus, then became king. As a result of breaking his vow to love Medea forever, Jason lost his favor with Hera and died lonely and unhappy. He was asleep under the stern of the rotting \"\"Argo\"\" when it fell on him, killing him instantly. Though some of the episodes of Jason's story draw on ancient material, the definitive telling, on which this account relies, is that of Apollonius of Rhodes in his epic poem \"\"Argonautica\"\", written in Alexandria in the late 3rd century BC.\n[5] Title: Jason Text:  Creusa's father, Creon, burned to death with his daughter as he tried to save her. Then Medea killed the two boys that she bore to Jason, fearing that they would be murdered or enslaved as a result of their mother's actions. When Jason came to know of this, Medea was already gone; she fled to Athens in a chariot of dragons sent by her grandfather, the sun-god Helios. Later Jason and Peleus, father of the hero Achilles, attacked and defeated Acastus, reclaiming the throne of Iolcus for himself once more.\nQuestion: what is jason 's last name in the lost hero\nYour answer: ",

Local references in the film include Warren G. Harding Elementary School and Cleveland Street (where Shepherd spent his childhood). Other local references include mention of a person \"\"swallowing a yo-yo\"\" in nearby Griffith, the Old Man being one of the fiercest \"\"furnace fighters in northern Indiana\"\" and that his obscenities were \"\"hanging in space over Lake Michigan,\"\" a mention of the Indianapolis 500, and the line to Santa Claus \"\"stretching all the way to Terre Haute, Indiana.\"\"\n[2] Title: \"A Christmas Story House\" Text:  The house, as it is portrayed in the film, is located in Hohman, Indiana, the fictional town modeled after Shepherd's native Hammond, Indiana. For the film adaptation of these stories, director Bob Clark reportedly sent scouts to twenty cities before selecting Cleveland for exterior filming. Cleveland was chosen because of Higbee's Department Store, which ultimately was featured in three scenes in the film. Appropriately, the fictional boyhood home of Ralphie Parker is on Cleveland Street, the name of the actual street where Shepherd grew up.\n[3] Title: \"A Christmas Story House\" Text:  A Christmas Story House A Christmas Story House is a museum in Cleveland, Ohio's Tremont neighborhood. The 19th-century Victorian, which was used in the exterior scenes of Ralphie Parker's house in the 1983 film \"\"A Christmas Story\"\", was purchased by a private developer in 2004 and has been restored and renovated to appear as it did both inside and outside in the film. The museum is part of a complex of three buildings devoted to the film, and is open to the public year-round. The screenplay for \"\"A Christmas Story\"\" is based on material from author Jean Shepherd's collection of short stories, \"\"In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash\"\".\n[4] Title: \"A Christmas Story House\" Text:  In addition, the house to the left of the museum features a gift shop with movie memorabilia.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Prince of Wales\" Text:  In 1240, the title was theoretically inherited by his son Dafydd ap Llywelyn, though he is not known to have used it. Instead he styled himself as \"\"Prince of Wales\"\" around 1244, the first Welsh prince to do so. In 1246, his nephew Llywelyn ap Gruffudd succeeded to the throne of Gwynedd, and used the style as early as 1258. In 1267, with the signing of the Treaty of Montgomery, he was recognised by both King Henry III of England and the representative of the Papacy as Prince of Wales.\n[2] Title: \"Prince of Wales\" Text:  It was not until 1409 that his revolt in quest of Welsh independence was suppressed by Henry IV. The tradition of conferring the title \"\"Prince of Wales\"\" on the heir apparent of the monarch is usually considered to have begun in 1301, when King Edward I of England invested his son Edward of Caernarfon with the title at a Parliament held in Lincoln. According to legend, the king had promised the Welsh that he would name \"\"a prince born in Wales, who did not speak a word of English\"\" and then produced his infant son, who had been born at Caernarfon, to their surprise.\n[3] Title: \"Kingdom of England\" Text:  Edward I defeated Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and so effectively conquered Wales, in 1282. He created the title Prince of Wales for his heir, the future Edward II, in 1301. Edward I's conquest was brutal and the subsequent repression considerable, as the magnificent Welsh castles such as Conwy, Harlech, and Caernarfon attest; but this event re-united under a single ruler the lands of Roman Britain for the first time since the establishment of the Kingdom of the Jutes in Kent in the 5th century, some 700 years before.\n[4] Title: \"Prince of Wales\" Text:  The convention began in 1399; all previous Princes of Wales also received the earldom, but separately from the title of Prince. Indeed, before 1272 a hereditary and not necessarily royal Earldom of Chester had already been created several times, eventually merging in the Crown each time. The earldom was recreated, merging in the Crown in 1307 and again in 1327. Its creations since have been associated with the creations of the Prince of Wales. On 31 October 1460, Richard of York was briefly created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, Duke of Cornwall and Lord Protector of England by an Act of Parliament following the Act of Accord, as part of his arrangement to succeed Henry VI as king instead of Henry's own son.\n[5] Title: \"Prince of Wales\" Text:  It was Edward III who revived the practice of naming the eldest son Prince of Wales, which was then maintained by his successors: Nevertheless, according to conventional wisdom, since 1301 the Prince of Wales has usually been the eldest living son (if and only if he is also the heir apparent) of the King or Queen Regnant of England (subsequently of Great Britain, 1707, and of the United Kingdom, 1801). That he is also the heir apparent is important. Following the death of Prince Arthur, the Prince of Wales, Henry VII invested his second son, the future Henry VIII, with the title\u2014although only after it was clear that Arthur's wife, Catherine of Aragon, was not pregnant; when Frederick, Prince of Wales died while his father reigned, George II created Frederick's son George (the king's grandson and new heir apparent) Prince of Wales.\nQuestion: when was the title prince of wales created\nYour answer: ",

After the rediscovery of Mendel's work there was a feud between William Bateson and Pearson over the hereditary mechanism, solved by Ronald Fisher in his work \"\"The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance\"\". In 1910, Thomas Hunt Morgan showed that genes reside on specific chromosomes. He later showed that genes occupy specific locations on the chromosome. With this knowledge, Morgan and his students began the first chromosomal map of the fruit fly \"\"Drosophila melanogaster\"\".\n[2] Title: \"Thomas Hunt Morgan\" Text:  In his famous Fly Room at Columbia University, Morgan demonstrated that genes are carried on chromosomes and are the mechanical basis of heredity. These discoveries formed the basis of the modern science of genetics. During his distinguished career, Morgan wrote 22 books and 370 scientific papers. As a result of his work, \"\"Drosophila\"\" became a major model organism in contemporary genetics. The Division of Biology which he established at the California Institute of Technology has produced seven Nobel Prize winners. Morgan was born in Lexington, Kentucky, to Charlton Hunt Morgan and Ellen Key Howard Morgan.\n[3] Title: \"History of molecular biology\" Text:  After the rediscovery of the laws of Mendel through the studies of Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns and Erich von Tschermak in 1900, this science began to take shape thanks to the adoption by Thomas Hunt Morgan, in 1910, of a model organism for genetic studies, the famous fruit fly (\"\"Drosophila melanogaster\"\"). Shortly after, Morgan showed that the genes are localized on chromosomes. Following this discovery, he continued working with Drosophila and, along with numerous other research groups, confirmed the importance of the gene in the life and development of organisms.\n[4] Title: \"History of biology\" Text:  1900 marked the so-called \"\"rediscovery of Mendel\"\": Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich von Tschermak independently arrived at Mendel's laws (which were not actually present in Mendel's work). Soon after, cytologists (cell biologists) proposed that chromosomes were the hereditary material. Between 1910 and 1915, Thomas Hunt Morgan and the \"\"Drosophilists\"\" in his fly lab forged these two ideas\u2014both controversial\u2014into the \"\"Mendelian-chromosome theory\"\" of heredity. They quantified the phenomenon of genetic linkage and postulated that genes reside on chromosomes like beads on string; they hypothesized crossing over to explain linkage and constructed genetic maps of the fruit fly \"\"Drosophila melanogaster\"\", which became a widely used model organism.\n[5] Title: \"Alfred Sturtevant\" Text:  During this time frame, Hugo de Vries put forth a theory that persistent hereditary units are passed through generations and that each \u201cunit\u201d deals with a specific characteristic and the units can combine in different ways in the offspring. From 1900\u20131909, anomalous data began to accumulate. Gene linkage was first reported by Carl Correns in 1900, contradicting Mendel's law of independent assortment. Thomas Hunt Morgan was the first to provide a working hypothesis for these exceptions. He postulated that genes that remained together while being passed from generation to generation must be located on the same chromosome.\nQuestion: who proved that genes are located on chromosomes\nYour answer: ",

The Robinson projection is neither equal-area nor conformal, abandoning both for a compromise. The creator felt this produced a better overall view than could be achieved by adhering to either. The meridians curve gently, avoiding extremes, but thereby stretch the poles into long lines instead of leaving them as points. Hence, distortion close to the poles is severe, but quickly declines to moderate levels moving away from them.\n[2] Title: \"Robinson projection\" Text:  The straight parallels imply severe angular distortion at the high latitudes toward the outer edges of the map, a fault inherent in any pseudocylindrical projection. However, at the time it was developed, the projection effectively met Rand McNally's goal to produce appealing depictions of the entire world. The projection is defined by the table: The table is indexed by latitude at 5 degree intervals; intermediate values are calculated using interpolation. Robinson did not specify any particular interpolation method, but it is reported that he used Aitken interpolation himself. The PLEN column is the length of the parallel of latitude, and the PDFE column is multiplied by 0.5072 to obtain the distance of that parallel from the equator.\n[3] Title: \"Arthur H. Robinson\" Text:  In 1961, Rand McNally asked Robinson to choose a projection for use as a world map that, among other criteria, was uninterrupted, had limited distortion, and was pleasing to the eye of general viewers. Robinson could not find a projection that satisfied the criteria, so Rand McNally commissioned him to design one. Robinson proceeded through an iterative process to create a pseudo-cylindrical projection that intends to strike a compromise between distortions in areas and in distances, in order to attain a more natural visualization. The projection has been widely used since its introduction.\n[4] Title: \"Lost in Space (film)\" Text:  The robot activates soon after and begins to destroy the navigation and guidance systems, en route to destroying the family itself. Smith awakens the Robinsons and West, who manage to subdue the robot, but the ship is falling uncontrollably into the sun.

Other early examples include Browning Hall, formed in Walworth in 1895 by Francis Herbert Stead, and Mansfield House Settlement, also in east London (see Percy Alden). There is also a global network, the International Federation of Settlements. The movement gave rise to many social policy initiatives and innovative ways of working to improve the conditions of the most excluded members of society. The Poor Man's Lawyer service came about because a barrister volunteered his time and encouraged his friends to do the same.\n[2] Title: \"Samuel Barnett (reformer)\" Text:  This resulted in the formation of the University Settlements Association. Toynbee Hall, named after the recently deceased historian Arnold Toynbee, was built shortly afterwards, and Barnett became its first Warden. In 1888 American reformer Jane Addams visited the settlement, and was inspired to create similar facilities in the United States\u2014the first Hull House opening in Chicago a year later. Barnett was a select preacher at Oxford (1895\u201397), and at Cambridge in 1900. In 1893 he received a canonry in Bristol Cathedral, but retained his wardenship of Toynbee Hall, while relinquishing the living of St. Jude's.\n[3] Title: \"Social Gospel\" Text:  Many reformers inspired by the movement opened settlement houses, most notably Hull House in Chicago operated by Jane Addams. They helped the poor and immigrants improve their lives. Settlement houses offered services such as daycare, education, and health care to needy people in slum neighbourhoods. The YMCA was created originally to help rural youth adjust to the city without losing their religion, but by the 1890s became a powerful instrument of the Social Gospel.

Faltermeyer recorded the song using five instruments: a Roland Jupiter-8 provided the distinctive \"\"supersaw\"\" lead sound, a Moog modular synthesizer 15 provided the bass, a Roland JX-3P provided chord stabs, a Yamaha DX7 was used for bell and vibraphone sounds and a LinnDrum was used for drum programming.\n[4] Title: \"Beverly Hills Cop\" Text:  (Adjusted for inflation, \"\"Beverly Hills Cop\"\" is the third highest-grossing R rated film of all-time behind \"\"The Exorcist\"\" and \"\"The Godfather\"\".)

Branagh's version was a former Confederate military engineer who had lost most of his lower body in an accidental explosion. As a double amputee he used a steam-powered wheelchair and similar innovative contraptions. Loveless was incensed at the South's surrender and sought to dismember the United States and distribute its territory amongst the Native American tribes and its original European colonizers (while keeping the Northern Plains for himself).\n[2] Title: \"The Wild Wild West\" Text:  In 1999, a theatrical feature-length film loosely based on the series was released as \"\"Wild Wild West\"\" (without the definite article used in the series title). Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, the film made substantial changes to the characters of the series re-imagining James West as a black man (played by Will Smith) and Artemus Gordon (played by Kevin Kline) as egotistical and bitterly competitive with West. Additionally, significant changes were made to Dr. Loveless (Kenneth Branagh in the film). No longer a dwarf, he was portrayed as a double amputee with no legs in a steam-powered wheelchair (similar to that employed by the villain in the episode \"\"The Night of the Brain\"\").\n[3] Title: \"Wild Wild West\" Text:  Clooney dropped out citing an agreement with Sonnenfeld: \"\"Ultimately, we all decided that rather than damage this project trying to retrofit the role for me, it was better to step aside and let them get someone else.\"\" The film featured several significant changes from the television series. For example, Dr. Loveless as portrayed by Kenneth Branagh in the film went from a dwarf to a man without legs; his first name was also changed from Miguelito to Arliss and was given the motive of a Southerner who sought the defeat of the North after the Civil War.\n[4] Title: \"The Wild Wild West\" Text:  He had a long-standing feud with producer Jon Peters which may have colored his opinion. He was offended at the racial aspects of the film as well as the casting of Branagh as a double amputee rather than a little-person actor in the role of Loveless. Conrad took special delight in accepting the Golden Raspberry Awards for the film in 1999. It was awarded Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay and Worst Original Song. In 2009, Will Smith apologized publicly to Conrad while doing promotion for \"\"Seven Pounds\"\": The first season of \"\"The Wild Wild West\"\" was released on DVD in North America on June 6, 2006 by CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment).\n[5] Title: \"Dr. Loveless\" Text:  He also has a personal history with Jim West; an early tank he designed massacred the population of a freed slave colony, including West's parents (in the film, West, portrayed by Will Smith, is African-American).

As its use spread north of the border, cannabis became stigmatized due to strong anti-Mexican sentiments that had taken hold. By 1936, the non-medical use of cannabis had been banned in every state. Cannabis was then effectively outlawed at the federal level, following the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. Cannabis remained mostly an underground drug until the 1960s, when it found widespread popularity among large numbers of young people and hippies, and was used commonly at protests against the Vietnam War.\n[2] Title: \"Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States\" Text:  Cannabis was officially banned for any use (medical included) with the passage of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, following a constitutional challenge to the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. The movement to legalize cannabis in the U.S. was sparked by the 1964 arrest of , a San Francisco man who walked into the city's Hall of Justice and lit up a joint, requesting to be arrested. As it was a felony to use cannabis in California, Eggemeier was quickly hauled off to prison, where he was held for close to a year.\n[3] Title: \"Medical cannabis\" Text:  In the United States, the medical use of cannabis further declined with the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, which imposed new regulations and fees on physicians prescribing cannabis. Cannabis was removed from the U.S. Pharmacopeia in 1941, and officially banned for any use with the passage of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Cannabis began to attract renewed interest as medicine in the 1970s and 1980s, in particular due to its use by cancer and AIDS patients who reported relief from the effects of chemotherapy and wasting syndrome. In 1996, California became the first U.S. state to legalize medical cannabis in defiance of federal law.\n[4] Title: \"Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States\" Text:  Efforts to legalize cannabis in the U.S. included a number of ballot initiatives leading up to 2012, but none succeeded. In 2012, success was finally achieved when Washington and Colorado became the first two states to legalize. In 2014 and 2016 several more states followed, and in 2018 Vermont became the first to legalize through an act of state legislature. All jurisdictions that have legalized allow for the commercial distribution of cannabis, except Vermont and the District of Columbia. All allow for personal cultivation, except Washington state. At the federal level, cannabis remains prohibited for any use under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.\n[5] Title: \"Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States\" Text:  After Nebraska decriminalized cannabis in 1978, no other state would follow for over two decades, until Nevada decriminalized in 2001. In subsequent years a number of major cities decriminalized cannabis or made enforcement of cannabis laws the lowest priority. Among the first major cities to pass such laws were Seattle (2003), Oakland (2004), Denver (2005), and San Francisco (2006). In the years that followed reform efforts continued to gain steam, with decriminalization laws passing in Massachusetts (2008), Connecticut (2011), Rhode Island (2012), Vermont (2013), the District of Columbia (2014), Maryland (2014), Missouri (2014), the U.S. Virgin Islands (2014), Delaware (2015), Illinois (2016), and New Hampshire (2017).\nQuestion: when was pot made illegal in the us\nYour answer: ",

The coloration is brownish with a yellow or greenish hue and with isolated black flecks. The coloring tends to wash out quite strongly in older animals. The underside is almost always solid horn color and has separate black patches on either side of the central seam. The head is brown to black, with fine scales. The forelegs similarly possess fine scales. The limbs generally have five claws, which are darkly colored at their base.\n[2] Title: \"Hermann's tortoise\" Text:  Generally, the forelegs have no black pigmentation on their undersides. The base of the claws is often lightly colored. The tail in males is larger than in females and possesses a spike. Generally, the shell protecting the tail is divided. A few specimens can be found with undivided shells, similar to the Greek tortoise. The subspecies \"\"T. h. hercegovinensis\"\", known as the Dalmatian tortoise, (Balkans coast) and the local \"\"T. h. peloponnesica\"\" (southwestern Peloponnesus coast) are now included here; they constitute local forms that are not yet geographically or in other ways reproductively isolated and apparently, derive from relict populations of the last ice age.\n[3] Title: \"Hermann's tortoise\" Text:  Their scaly limbs are greyish to brown, with some yellow markings, and their tails bear a spur (a horny spike) at the tip. Adult males have particularly long and thick tails, and well-developed spurs, distinguishing them from females.

A specimen of this size may weigh . \"\"T. h. hermanni\"\" rarely grows larger than .

The particularly strong tail ends in a spike, which may be very large in older male specimens. Females have noticeably smaller tail spikes, which are slightly bent toward the body. Early in the morning, the animals leave their nightly shelters, which are usually hollows protected by thick bushes or hedges, to bask in the sun and warm their bodies. They then roam about the Mediterranean meadows of their habitat in search of food. They determine which plants to eat by the sense of smell.\n[5] Title: \"Hermann's tortoise\" Text:  Immediately after surfacing from their winter resting place, Hermann\u2019s tortoises commence courtship and mating. Courtship is a rough affair for the female, which is pursued, rammed, and bitten by the male, before being mounted. Aggression is also seen between rival males during the breeding season, which can result in ramming contests. Between May and July, female Hermann\u2019s tortoises deposit between two and 12 eggs into flask-shaped nests dug into the soil, up to deep.

William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascension to the throne as William III of England jointly with his wife, Mary II, James's daughter, after the Declaration of Right, leading to the Bill of Rights 1689.\n[2] Title: \"Restoration (England)\" Text:  The Glorious Revolution which overthrew King James II of England was propelled by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange-Nassau (William of Orange). William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his accession to the English throne as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England, James' daughter. In April 1688, James re-issued the \"\"Declaration of Indulgence\"\" and ordered all Anglican clergymen to read it to their congregations. When seven bishops, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, submitted a petition requesting the reconsideration of the King's religious policies, they were arrested and tried for seditious libel.\n[3] Title: \"Right of revolution\" Text:  During the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the Parliament of England effectively deposed James II of England and replaced him with William III of Orange-Nassau, due to the former's unacceptable leanings towards absolutism and Catholicism. Although Locke's treatise was published the year after, his ideas were already widely current in the English political system at the time. Although Locke claimed that his book's purpose was to justify William III's ascension to the throne, it has been argued that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679\u20131680 during the Exclusion Crisis, which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place.\n[4] Title: \"Two Treatises of Government\" Text:  This is known as the Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688. Locke claims in the \"\"Preface\"\" to the \"\"Two Treatises\"\" that its purpose is to justify William III's ascension to the throne, though Peter Laslett suggests that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679\u20131680 (and subsequently revised until Locke was driven into exile in 1683). According to Laslett, Locke was writing his \"\"Two Treatises\"\" during the Exclusion Crisis, which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place.\n[5] Title: \"Military history of the Netherlands\" Text:  The protection of British and Dutch commerce was never complete, for the French privateers were active to the end, but French commerce was wholly ruined.

Though this was in fact a military conflict between Great Britain and The Republic, William invading the British Isles with a Dutch fleet and army, in English histories it is never described as such because he had strong support in England and was partly serving the dynastic interests of his wife.\nQuestion: who came to the throne in the glorious revolution\nYour answer: ",

When he did, he did not choose, as was generally the custom, his father's name, Maredudd, but chose that of his grandfather, Tudur ap Goronwy, instead. This name is sometimes given as \"\"Tewdwr\"\", the Welsh form of Theodore, but Modern Welsh \"\"Tudur\"\", Old Welsh \"\"Tutir\"\" is originally not a variant but a different and completely unrelated name, etymologically identical with Gaulish \"\"Toutorix\"\", from Proto-Celtic \"\"*tout\u0101\"\" \"\"people, tribe\"\" and \"\"*r\u012bxs\"\" \"\"king\"\" (compare Modern Welsh \"\"tud\"\" \"\"territory\"\" and \"\"rhi\"\" \"\"king\"\" respectively), corresponding to Germanic Theodoric.\n[2] Title: \"House of Tudor\" Text:  It symbolized the Tudor's right to rule as well the uniting of the kingdom after the Wars of the Roses. It was used by every English, then British, monarch since Henry VII as a royal badge. The Tudors also used monograms to denote themselves: As noted above Tewdur or Tudor is derived from the words tud \"\"territory\"\" and rhi \"\"king\"\". Owen Tudor took it as a surname on being knighted. It is doubtful whether the Tudor kings used the name on the throne.\n[3] Title: \"House of Tudor\" Text:  House of Tudor The House of Tudor was an English royal house of Welsh origin, descended in the male line from the Tudors of Penmynydd. Tudor monarchs ruled the Kingdom of England and its realms, including their ancestral Wales and the Lordship of Ireland (later the Kingdom of Ireland) from 1485 until 1603, with five monarchs in that period. The Tudors succeeded the House of Plantagenet as rulers of the Kingdom of England, and were succeeded by the House of Stuart. The first Tudor monarch, Henry VII of England, descended through his mother from a legitimised branch of the English royal House of Lancaster.\n[4] Title: \"House of Tudor\" Text:  Numerous feature films are based on Tudor history.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Causing death by dangerous driving\" Text:  A person convicted of causing death by dangerous driving is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years. Disqualification for a minimum of two years is obligatory on conviction. Endorsement is obligatory on conviction. The offence carries three to eleven penalty points (when the defendant is exceptionally not disqualified). The Court of Appeal in R v Cooksley and others gave guidelines for cases where death is caused by dangerous driving. In R v Richardson the Court of Appeal reassessed the starting point set out in R v Cooksley taking into consideration the increase in the maximum penalty.\n[2] Title: \"Causing death by dangerous driving\" Text:  The relevant starting points identified in Cooksley should be reassessed as follows: When a court disqualifies a person on conviction for causing death by dangerous driving, it must order an extended retest. Part I of Schedule 2 to the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 originally provided that a person convicted of this offence was liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. It was amended by section 67(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 on 16 August 1993 so as to increase the maximum term to ten years. The Road Safety Act 2006 introduced two new offences, of \"\"causing death by careless, or inconsiderate driving\"\" and a distinct offence for causing (any) death by driving when unlicensed, or disqualified.\n[3] Title: \"Causing death by dangerous driving\" Text:  An equivalent, under Republic of Ireland traffic laws, to causing death by dangerous driving, is \"\"Dangerous driving causing death\"\". The maximum period of imprisonment, for such a conviction, is 10 years. The minimum licence suspension is 5 years. The UK and Republic of Ireland are parties to the 1998 EU Convention on Driving Disqualifications (98/C 216/01) and therefore convictions for dangerous driving causing death in the UK are counted on a person's Republic of Ireland driving record. In many American states, vehicular homicide is an equivalent to causing death by dangerous driving.\n[4] Title: \"Vehicular homicide\" Text:  The Criminal Code does not have a specific offence for vehicular homicide, but has a series of provisions covering driving offences causing death, among them: The maximum penalty for dangerous driving causing death, absent any of the remaining 5 elements mentioned above, is 14 years' imprisonment. The maximum penalty is otherwise life imprisonment. Anyone sentenced to life imprisonment for a Criminal Code driving offence is eligible to apply for parole after serving 7 years, but there is no guarantee of parole. In the United Kingdom, there is no offense of \"\"vehicular homicide\"\".\n[5] Title: \"Causing death by dangerous driving\" Text:  Disqualifications for dangerous operation of a vehicle causing death are included. In Canada, the Criminal Code has several road traffic offences equivalent to causing death by dangerous driving. The basic offence, \"\"\"\", has a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment. If the driver is convicted of failing to stop for police, criminal negligence, street racing, a hit and run or drink-driving, in addition to dangerous driving, and a death resulted, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment. A person's Canada-wide driving privileges will be suspended, for any Criminal Code driving conviction, although lengths of suspensions vary by province and territory.\nQuestion: maximum sentence for death by dangerous driving uk\nYour answer: ",

The bridge opened in 1967 and was Minnesota's third busiest, carrying 140,000 vehicles daily. The NTSB cited a design flaw as the likely cause of the collapse, noting that a too-thin gusset plate ripped along a line of rivets, and additional weight on the bridge at the time contributed to the catastrophic failure.\n[3] Title: \"I-35W Mississippi River bridge\" Text:  It had a catastrophic failure during the evening rush hour on August 1, 2007, killing 13 people and injuring 145.

In 1996, the Los Angeles Lakers acquired the draft rights to high school player Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets by trading established center Vlade Divac. No NBA team had previously drafted a guard straight from high school.

Prior to the 1996 NBA draft, Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles, where he scrimmaged against former Lakers players Larry Drew and Michael Cooper and, according to then-Laker manager Jerry West, \"\"marched over these people\"\". The Lakers were looking to trade their starting center Vlade Divac for a player's draft rights in order to free up salary cap space to make an offer to free agent center Shaquille O'Neal.\n[4] Title: \"Kobe Bryant\" Text:  However, on June 30, Divac relented on his threat and the trade was made final on July 9, 1996 when the league's offseason moratorium ended. Since Bryant was still 17 at the time, his parents had to cosign his contract with the Lakers until he was able to sign his own when he turned 18 before the season began.

This version was released as a single from their \"\"Workin' Together\"\" album and the song differed greatly from the structure of the original, but is also well known and has become one of Tina Turner's most recognizable signature songs. The Turners' version was substantially rearranged by Soko Richardson and Ike Turner. The song started off with a slow, sultry soulful tone in which Tina introduced the song and warned the audience that she and the band were gonna start it off \"\"nice and easy\"\" as \"\"we never do nothing nice and easy\"\" but said they would finish it \"\"nice and rough\"\".\n[2] Title: \"Proud Mary\" Text:  Ike and Tina first performed a version of the song on \"\"The Ed Sullivan Show\"\" on January 11, 1970 just days before they entered the studio to record the song.

In the Tina Turner biopic, \"\"What's Love Got to Do with It\"\", the song is performed in a timeline of events in Ike and Tina's career in which the couple are transformed from an opening act to The Rolling Stones to a major headlining act by the mid-1970s.\n[4] Title: \"Ike & Tina Turner\" Text:  In January 1970, the group performed on \"\"The Ed Sullivan Show\"\". Later in 1970, the duo accepted the opportunity to perform in the Milos Forman film, \"\"Taking Off\"\", which was later released to theaters in 1971. The Revue's performance fee increased from $1,000 a night to $5,000 a night following their successful run. During live performances, Ike and Tina included the Creedence Clearwater Revival's hit \"\"Proud Mary\"\" on their sets. Sensing hit potential, Bob Krasnow and executives at Liberty convinced the duo to record a version of the song.\n[5] Title: \"Ike & Tina Turner\" Text:  Ike & Tina Turner Ike & Tina Turner were an American musical duo composed of the husband-and-wife team of Ike Turner and Tina Turner. The duo was once considered \"\"one of the hottest, most durable, and potentially most explosive of all R&B ensembles\"\". Their early works, including \"\"A Fool in Love\"\", \"\"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\"\", \"\"I Idolize You\"\" and \"\"River Deep \u2013 Mountain High\"\", became high points in the development of soul music, while their later works were noted for wildly interpretive re-arrangements of rock songs such as \"\"I Want to Take You Higher\"\" and \"\"Proud Mary\"\", the latter song for which they won a Grammy Award.\nQuestion: who sang proud mary first tina turner or ccr\nYour answer: ",

Corral\" Text:  The story was widely printed in newspapers across the United States. Most versions favored the lawmen. The headline in the \"\"San Francisco Exchange\"\" was, \"\"\"\"A Good Riddance\"\"\"\". Three days after the shootout, the ruling of the Coroner's Jury convened by Dr. Henry Matthews neither condemned nor exonerated the lawmen for shooting the Cowboys. \"\"William Clanton, Frank and Thomas McLaury, came to their deaths in the town of Tombstone on October 26, 1881, from the effects of pistol and gunshot wounds inflicted by Virgil Earp, Morgan Earp, Wyatt Earp, and one\u2014Holliday, commonly called 'Doc Holliday'.\"\"\n[2] Title: \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\" Text:  Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne both said they were unarmed when they fled the gunfight. The bodies of the three dead Cowboys were displayed in a window at Ritter and Reams undertakers with a sign: \"\"Murdered in the Streets of Tombstone.\"\" The funerals for Billy Clanton (age 19), Tom McLaury (age 28) and his older brother Frank (age 33) were well attended. About 300 people joined in the procession to Boot Hill and as many as two thousand watched from the sidewalks. Both McLaurys were buried in the same grave, and Billy Clanton was buried nearby.\n[3] Title: \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\" Text:  Despite its name, the gunfight did not take place within or next to the O.K. Corral, which fronted Allen Street and had a rear entrance lined with horse stalls on Fremont Street. The shootout actually took place in a narrow lot on the side of C. S. Fly's Photographic Studio on Fremont Street, six doors west of the O.K. Corral's rear entrance. Some members of the two opposing parties were initially only about apart. About 30 shots were fired in 30 seconds. Tom and Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton were killed.\n[4] Title: \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\" Text:  Both Wyatt and Virgil believed Tom McLaury was armed and testified that he had fired at least one shot over the back of a horse. Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury exchanged gunfire with the lawmen. During the gunfight, Doc Holliday was bruised by a bullet fired by Frank that struck his holster and grazed his hip. Virgil Earp was shot through the calf, he thought by Billy Clanton. Morgan Earp was struck across both shoulder blades by a bullet that Morgan thought Frank McLaury had fired. Wyatt Earp was unhurt. Tom McLaury, his brother Frank, and Billy Clanton were killed.\n[5] Title: \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\" Text:  All three Earp brothers had been the target of repeated death threats made by the Cowboys, who objected to the Earps' interference in their illegal activities. The four law men faced five Cowboys. Billy Clanton and both McLaury brothers were killed. Ike Clanton claimed that he was unarmed and ran from the fight, along with Billy Claiborne and Wes Fuller. Virgil, Morgan, and Doc Holliday were wounded, but Wyatt Earp was unharmed. The shootout has come to represent a period of the American Old West when the frontier was virtually an open range for outlaws, largely unopposed by law enforcement officers who were spread thin over vast territories.\nQuestion: who died at the gunfight at okay corral\nYour answer: ",

This section was one of the first to be renovated following the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution. At the edge of the Bohai Gulf is Shanhai Pass, considered the traditional end of the Great Wall and the \"\"First Pass Under Heaven\"\". The part of the wall inside Shanhai Pass that meets the sea is named the \"\"Old Dragon Head\"\". north of Shanhai Pass is Jiaoshan Great Wall (\u7126\u5c71\u9577\u57ce), the site of the first mountain of the Great Wall.\n[2] Title: \"Great Wall of China\" Text:  northeast from Shanhaiguan is Jiumenkou \"\"Ji\u01d4m\u00e9nk\u01d2u\"\"), which is the only portion of the wall that was built as a bridge. Beyond Jiumenkou, an offshoot known as the Liaodong Wall continues through Liaoning province and terminates at the Hushan Great Wall, in the city of Dandong near the North Korean border. In 2009, 180 km of previously unknown sections of the wall concealed by hills, trenches and rivers were discovered with the help of infrared range finders and GPS devices. In March and April 2015 nine sections with a total length of more than , believed to be part of the Great Wall, were discovered along the border of Ningxia autonomous region and Gansu province.\n[3] Title: \"Defense of the Great Wall\" Text:  Shanhaiguan is the fortified eastern end of the Great Wall of China, where the Great Wall meets the ocean. Per the terms of the 1901 Boxer Rebellion accord, the Imperial Japanese Army maintained a small garrison of around 200 men at Shanhaiguan. On the night of 1 January 1933, the Japanese garrison commander staged an \"\"incident\"\" by exploding a few hand grenades and firing a few shots. The Kwantung Army used this as an excuse to demand that the Chinese 626th Regiment of the Northeastern Army, guarding Shanhaiguan, evacuate the pass defenses.\n[4] Title: \"Great Wall of China\" Text:  Although Han fortifications such as Yumen Pass and the Yang Pass exist further west, the extant walls leading to those passes are difficult to trace. From Jiayu Pass the wall travels discontinuously down the Hexi Corridor and into the deserts of Ningxia, where it enters the western edge of the Yellow River loop at Yinchuan. Here the first major walls erected during the Ming dynasty cuts through the Ordos Desert to the eastern edge of the Yellow River loop. There at Piantou Pass \"\"Pi\u0101nt\u00f3ugu\u0101n\"\") in Xinzhou, Shanxi province, the Great Wall splits in two with the \"\"Outer Great Wall\"\" \"\"W\u00e0i Ch\u01cengch\u00e9ng\"\") extending along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into Hebei province, and the \"\"inner Great Wall\"\" \"\"N\u00e8i Ch\u01cengch\u00e9ng\"\") running southeast from Piantou Pass for some , passing through important passes like the Pingxing Pass and Yanmen Pass before joining the Outer Great Wall at Sihaiye in Beijing's Yanqing County.\n[5] Title: \"Great Wall of China\" Text:  The travelogues of the later 19th century further enhanced the reputation and the mythology of the Great Wall, such that in the 20th century, a persistent misconception exists about the Great Wall of China being visible from the Moon or even Mars. Although a formal definition of what constitutes a \"\"Great Wall\"\" has not been agreed upon, making the full course of the Great Wall difficult to describe in its entirety, the course of the main Great Wall line following Ming constructions can be charted. The Jiayu Pass, located in Gansu province, is the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall.\nQuestion: where does great wall of china start and end\nYour answer: ",

The peaks, which form part of the Pennine range, encircle the head of the valley of the River Ribble in the Yorkshire Dales National Park in the North of England. The long-standing designation \"\"The Three Peaks\"\" is well known locally, and in past times nationally. However, there are now a number of \"\"National\"\" Three Peaks adventure challenges involving Ben Nevis, Snowdon and Scafell Pike (respectively the highest summits in Scotland, Wales and England).\n[2] Title: \"Yorkshire Three Peaks\" Text:  In addition to it being seen as a walking challenge it has also become a race for fell runners and cyclo-cross cyclists. However, there is no bridleway access to the peaks (except Ingleborough from the Ingleton side only) so any bicycle access is on a permissive basis on race days only. The Three Peaks were featured on the TV programme \"\"Seven Natural Wonders\"\" as one of the wonders of Yorkshire. Yorkshire Three Peaks The hills of Whernside (), Ingleborough () and Pen-y-ghent () are collectively known as the Three Peaks.\n[3] Title: \"Three Peaks Cyclo-Cross\" Text:  Three Peaks Cyclo-Cross The Three Peaks Cyclo-Cross is an annual cyclo-cross event over the Yorkshire three peaks of Ingleborough, Whernside and Pen-y-ghent, in Yorkshire, England. Organised by Bradford Racing Cycling Club on the last weekend of September, it bills itself as the \"\"hardest cyclo-cross race in the world\"\". While other races may have comparable or even greater distances and height gain\u2014Whernside, the tallest of the Peaks, only reaches 736 metres\u2014it is the combination of gradient, terrain, and weather that give the \"\"Three Peaks\"\" its reputation.\n[4] Title: \"Yorkshire Three Peaks\" Text:  The area is rich in historical interest. The summit of Ingleborough has the remains of a huge Iron Age hill fort, while the Settle-Carlisle Railway runs between the mountains, crossing Ribblehead Viaduct at the foot of Whernside. The Three Peaks walk of Pen-y-ghent, Whernside and Ingleborough is probably the original three peak walk within the UK. The first recorded ascent of the three hills was in July 1887 by J. R. Wynne-Edwards and D. R. Smith in a time of 10 hours. The walk covers a distance of to (depending on route) circuit of all three peaks with nearly of ascent and descent.\n[5] Title: \"Yorkshire Three Peaks\" Text:  However, walkers can still register the beginning and end of their walk at Pen-y-ghent Cafe. Those that complete the walk within 12 hours are invited to pay to join the Pen-y-ghent Cafe's privately owned 'Three Peaks of Yorkshire Club'. The Yorkshire Dales National Park runs a voluntary Friends of the Three Peaks project. The proceeds of this go towards the upkeep of the paths on the route. Certificates, medals and membership forms are awarded by local participating businesses. Understandably the Three Peaks Walk is seen by many as a challenge and it has become very popular for charity sponsored walks and Saturdays in early summer can see several hundred walkers make their way round the route.\nQuestion: what are the 3 peaks in yorkshire called\nYour answer: ",

Critics have regarded \"\"At Seventeen\"\" as a type of anthem.\n[2] Title: \"At Seventeen\" Text:  The Hong Kong all-female band at17 named themselves after the song. \"\"At Seventeen\"\" was written by Janis Ian and produced by Brooks Arthur. Ian was inspired to write the single after reading a \"\"The New York Times\"\" article about a young woman who believed her life would improve after a debutante ball and her subsequent disappointment. The article referenced the age eighteen, but Ian changed it to seventeen to fit with her samba guitar instrumental.

The omniscience of God refers to him being \"\"all knowing\"\". Berkhof regards the \"\"wisdom\"\" of God as a \"\"particular aspect of his knowledge.\"\" Romans 16:27 speaks about the \"\"only wise God\"\". The oneness, or \"\"unity\"\" of God refers to his being one and only.\n[2] Title: God Text:  God In monotheistic thought, God is conceived of as the supreme being, creator deity, and principal object of faith. The concept of God, as described by theologians, commonly includes the attributes of omniscience (all-knowing), omnipotence (all-powerful), omnipresence (all-present), and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Depending on one's kind of theism, these attributes are used either in way of analogy, or in a literal sense as distinct properties. God is most often held to be incorporeal (immaterial).\n[3] Title: \"Attributes of God in Christianity\" Text:  The attributes of God may be classified under two main categories: Millard Erickson calls these categories God's \"\"greatness\"\" and \"\"goodness\"\" respectively. The Westminster Shorter Catechism's definition of God is merely an enumeration of his attributes: \"\"God is a Spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth.\"\" The Westminster Larger Catechism adds certain attributes to this description, such as \"\"all-sufficient,\"\" \"\"incomprehensible,\"\" \"\"every where present\"\" and \"\"knowing all things\"\".\n[4] Title: \"Immutability (theology)\" Text:  3:6; 2 Tim. 2:13; Heb. 6:17\u201318; Jam. 1:17) God's immutability defines all God's other attributes: God is immutably wise, merciful, good, and gracious. The same may be said about God's knowledge: God is almighty (having all power), God is omnipotent (having all power), God is omnipresent (present everywhere), God is omniscient (knows everything), eternally and immutably so. Infiniteness and immutability in God are mutually supportive and imply each other. An infinite and changing God is inconceivable; indeed, it is a contradiction in definition.\n[5] Title: \"Divine simplicity\" Text:  A classic expression of this position is found in Maimonides' Guide to the Perplexed, According to Maimonides, then, there can be no plurality of faculties, moral dispositions, or essential attributes in God. Even to say that God is all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-good is to introduce plurality, if one means thereby that these qualities are separate attributes. Maimonides therefore concludes that it is not true to say that God's power is greater than ours, that God's life is more permanent than ours, or that God's knowledge is broader than ours.\nQuestion: which attribute of god refers to his all-knowing nature\nYour answer: ",

After asking the venue's security to take away the camera, Rose jumped into the audience, had a heated confrontation with the fan, and assaulted him. After being pulled from the audience by members of the crew, Rose said, \"\"Well, thanks to the lame-ass security, I'm going home! \"\", threw his microphone to the ground and stormed off the stage.\n[2] Title: \"Guns N' Roses\" Text:  As a result, \"\"Use Your Illusion's\"\" liner notes featured a hidden message amidst the \"\"Thank You\"\" section: \"\"Fuck You, St. Louis!\"\" Rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin abruptly quit the band on November 7, 1991, after a repeat of the St. Louis incident nearly unfolded during a concert in Germany. Stradlin cited a combination of Rose's personal behavior, his mismanagement of the band, and difficulties being around Slash, Sorum, and McKagan due to his newfound sobriety and their continuing addictions.\n[3] Title: \"Guns N' Roses\" Text:  The angry crowd rioted, injuring dozens. Footage was captured by Robert John, who was documenting the tour. The police were unable to arrest Rose until almost a year later, as the band went overseas to continue the tour. Charges were filed against Rose, but a judge ruled that he did not directly incite the riot. In his defense, Rose stated that the Guns N' Roses security team had made four separate requests to the venue's security staff to remove the camera, which were ignored, and that other members of the band had reported being hit by bottles launched from the audience, while the security staff refused to enforce a drinking limit.\n[4] Title: \"Guns N' Roses\" Text:  According to Guns' management, \"\"Axl's flight from L.A. had been delayed by mechanical troubles\"\".

Due to a second riot by fans in Philadelphia when the band failed to show up again, tour promoter Clear Channel canceled the remainder of the tour. Rose later mentioned in 2006, \"\"There are reasons that I have not spoken more about [cancelled shows in Vancouver and Philadelphia] that have been extremely complicated and are not legally resolved behind the scenes to this day and could have possibly jeopardized the future of Guns N' Roses.\"\"\n[5] Title: \"Guns N' Roses\" Text:  Metallica was forced to cancel the second hour of the show, but promised to return to the city for another performance. After a long delay, during which the audience became increasingly restless, Guns N' Roses took the stage. However, the shortened time between sets did not allow for adequate tuning of stage monitors and the band members could not hear themselves. In addition, Rose claimed that his throat hurt, causing the band to leave the stage early. The cancellation led to another audience riot, in which 10 audience members and three police officers were injured.\nQuestion: when was the guns and roses riot in st louis\nYour answer: ",

English has official status in the San Andr\u00e9s, Providencia and Santa Catalina Islands. The overwhelming majority of Colombians speak Spanish (see also Colombian Spanish), but in total 101 languages are listed for Colombia in the Ethnologue database. The specific number of spoken languages varies slightly since some authors consider as different languages what others consider to be varieties or dialects of the same language.\n[2] Title: \"Languages of Colombia\" Text:  The ten isolated languages are: Andoque, Awa-cuaiquer, Cof\u00e1n, Guambiano, Kaments\u00e1, P\u00e1ez, Ticuna, Tinigua, Yagua, Yaruro. There are also two Creole languages spoken in the country. The first is San Andr\u00e9s Creole, which is spoken alongside English in the San Andr\u00e9s, Providencia, and Catalina insular regions of Colombia. It is related to and mutually intelligible with many other English-based Creole languages (also known as Patois/Patwa) spoken in West Indian and Caribbean islands, although San Andres Creole (which is also sometimes called Saint Andrewan or Bende) has had more Spanish influence.\n[3] Title: Colombia Text:  The specific number of spoken languages varies slightly since some authors consider as different languages what others consider to be varieties or dialects of the same language. Best estimates recorded 71 languages that are spoken in-country today\u2014most of which belong to the Chibchan, Tucanoan, Bora\u2013Witoto, Guajiboan, Arawakan, Cariban, Barbacoan, and Saliban language families. There are currently about 850,000 speakers of native languages. Colombia is ethnically diverse, its people descending from the original native inhabitants, Spanish colonists, Africans originally brought to the country as slaves, and 20th-century immigrants from Europe and the Middle East, all contributing to a diverse cultural heritage.\n[4] Title: \"Languages of Colombia\" Text:  Best estimates recorded 71 languages that are spoken in-country today\u2014most of which belong to the Chibchan, Tucanoan, Bora\u2013Witoto, Guajiboan, Arawakan, Cariban, Barbacoan, and Saliban language families. There are currently about 850,000 speakers of native languages. Sixty-five indigenous languages that exist today can be regrouped into 12 language families and 10 language isolates, not yet classified. The languages are: the great linguistic family Chibchan, of probable Central American origin; the great South American families Arawakan, Cariban, Quechuan and Tupian; seven families only present at the regional level (Choc\u00f3, Guahibo, Saliba, Macu, Witoto, Bora, Tucano).\n[5] Title: \"Pa\u0301ez language\" Text:  Although many Colombian indigenous languages have disappeared since colonial times, there are still more than 60 languages in Colombia, classified into 10 linguistic families: Chibcha, Arawak, Caribe, Quichua, Tukano, Guahibo, Mak\u00fa-Puinave, Witoto-Bora, S\u00e1liba, and Choc\u00f3. Currently, the Chibcha family has languages from Santa Marta: Arhuaco, kogui, Wiwa, Tunebo, Motilone, Chimila and Cuna, but it used to be believed that Nasa Yuwe was part of the Chibcha family.

The sale of counterfeit eclipse glasses was also anticipated to be a hazard for eye injuries. Future total solar eclipses will cross the United States in April 2024 (12 states) and August 2045 (10 states), and annular solar eclipses\u2014wherein the Moon appears smaller than the Sun\u2014will occur in October 2023 (9 states) and June 2048 (9 states). The total eclipse had a magnitude of 1.0306 and was visible within a narrow corridor wide, crossing fourteen of the contiguous United States: Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.\n[2] Title: \"Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017\" Text:  An area of about , including the cities of Makanda, Carbondale, Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and Paducah, Kentucky, will thus experience two total solar eclipses within a span of less than seven years. The cities of Benton, Carbondale, Chester, Harrisburg, Marion, and Metropolis in Illinois; Cape Girardeau, Farmington, and Perryville in Missouri, as well as Paducah, Kentucky, will also be in the path of the 2024 eclipse, thereby earning the distinction of witnessing two total solar eclipses in seven years. The solar eclipse of August 12, 2045 will have a very similar path of totality over the U.S. to the 2017 eclipse: about 400 km (250 mi) to the southwest, also crossing the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the country; however, totality will be more than twice as long.\n[3] Title: \"Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017\" Text:  The August 2017 eclipse was the first with a path of totality crossing the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the U.S. since 1918. Also, its path of totality made landfall exclusively within the United States, making it the first such eclipse since the country's declaration of independence in 1776. Prior to this, the path of totality of the eclipse of June 13, 1257, was the last to make landfall exclusively on lands currently part of the United States. The path of the 2017 eclipse crosses with the path of the upcoming total solar eclipse of April 8, 2024, with the intersection of the two paths being in southern Illinois in Makanda Township at Cedar Lake, just south of Carbondale.\n[4] Title: \"Stonehenge II\" Text:  The new location of Stonehenge II sits directly in the path of the April 8, 2024 total solar eclipse. The duration of the eclipse will last for 4 minutes 26 seconds. Most of the stones are constructed of plaster applied to a wire mesh frame; however, two of the central stones are real, large, and probably unmovable without heavy equipment. Stonehenge II was featured as a backdrop for a scene in an early episode of the NBC TV series \"\"Friday Night Lights\"\" (Episode 19: \"\"Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes\"\").\n[5] Title: \"West Frankfort, Illinois\" Text:  The area was in totality during the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, with Giant City State Park, approximately 25 miles to the southwest, experiencing the longest period of totality during the eclipse (approximately 2 minutes and 40 seconds). It will also be within the path of totality of the solar eclipse of April 8, 2024, making it one of only a handful of cities within the direct paths of both eclipses. West Frankfort is located at (37.898545, -88.923315).

In modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March.\n[2] Title: \"Julius Caesar\" Text:  On the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC Caesar was assassinated by a group of rebellious senators led by Gaius Cassius Longinus, Marcus Junius Brutus and Decimus Junius Brutus, who stabbed him to death. A new series of civil wars broke out and the constitutional government of the Republic was never fully restored. Caesar's adopted heir Octavian, later known as Augustus, rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the civil war. Octavian set about solidifying his power and the era of the Roman Empire began. Much of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust.\n[3] Title: \"Sextus Pompey\" Text:  Gnaeus Pompeius was executed, but young Sextus escaped once more, this time to Sicily. Back in Rome, Julius Caesar was killed on the Ides of March (March 15) 44 BC by a group of senators led by Cassius and Brutus. This incident did not lead to a return to normality, but provoked yet another civil war between Caesar's political heirs and his killers. The Second Triumvirate was formed by Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, Marcus Antonius and Marcus Aemelius Lepidus, with the intention of avenging Caesar and subduing all opposition.\n[4] Title: \"Marcus Junius Brutus (Rome character)\" Text:  Brutus also insists that Mark Antony, Caesar's right-hand man and Lucius Vorenus, the new senator Caesar has appointed, must not be harmed. On the Ides of March, Brutus and the other senators involved in the plot attack Caesar on the Senate floor, stabbing him to death. Brutus watches in horror to begin with as the other senators attack Caesar and it is only when Caesar is bleeding to death on the Senate floor that Cassius forces the dagger into Brutus' hand and orders him to stab Caesar. Brutus kneels next to Caesar, both of them clearly heartbroken at seeing each other in such a state; he stabs Caesar and Caesar finally dies.\n[5] Title: \"Julius Caesar (play)\" Text:  On the eve of the ides of March, the conspirators meet and reveal that they have forged letters of support from the Roman people to tempt Brutus into joining. Brutus reads the letters and, after much moral debate, decides to join the conspiracy, thinking that Caesar should be killed to \"\"prevent\"\" him from doing anything against the people of Rome if he were ever to be crowned. After ignoring the soothsayer, as well as his wife Calpurnia's own premonitions, Caesar goes to the Senate. The conspirators approach him with a fake petition pleading on behalf of Metellus Cimber's banished brother.\nQuestion: who was killed on the ides of march\nYour answer: ",

She is the fifth presidential candidate in U.S. history to win the popular vote but lose the election. She won the most votes of any candidate who did not take office, and the third-most votes of any candidate in history, though she did not have the greatest percentage win of a losing candidate (Andrew Jackson won the popular vote by 10.4% but lost to John Quincy Adams).\n[2] Title: \"1888 United States presidential election\" Text:  Had Cleveland won his home state, he would have won the electoral vote by an electoral count of 204-197 (201 electoral votes were needed for victory in 1888). Instead, Cleveland became the third of only five candidates to win the popular vote but lose their respective presidential elections (Andrew Jackson in 1824, Samuel J. Tilden in 1876, Al Gore in 2000, and Hillary Clinton in 2016). Four states returned results where the winner won by less than 1 percent of the popular vote. Cleveland earned 24 of his electoral votes from states he won by less than one percent: Connecticut, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n[3] Title: \"Samuel J. Tilden\" Text:  Tilden was the second individual, after Andrew Jackson, to lose a presidential election despite winning the popular vote. Grover Cleveland, Al Gore, and Hillary Clinton have subsequently achieved the same feat. Tilden remains the only individual to lose a presidential election while winning a majority, rather than a plurality, of the popular vote. In 1878, Democratic Congressman Clarkson Nott Potter convinced the House of Representatives to create a committee to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption in the 1876 election. Potter was appointed as the head of the commission, which Democrats hoped would implicate Hayes and damage the Republican Party in the next presidential election.\n[4] Title: \"Samuel J. Tilden\" Text:  Samuel J. Tilden Samuel Jones Tilden (February 9, 1814 \u2013 August 4, 1886) was the 25th Governor of New York and the Democratic candidate for president in the disputed election of 1876. He was the only individual to win an outright majority of the popular vote in a United States presidential election but lose the election itself, though four other candidates have lost a presidential election despite garnering a plurality of the popular vote. Tilden was born into a wealthy family in New Lebanon, New York. Attracted to politics at a young age, he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Martin Van Buren, the eighth President of the United States.\n[5] Title: \"History of the United States Democratic Party\" Text:  Democrats have also won the popular vote in 2000 and 2016, but lost the Electoral College with Al Gore and Hillary Clinton, respectively. The 1876 and 1888 elections were other two presidential elections in which Democrats won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College (the Democrats candidates were Samuel J. Tilden and Grover Cleveland). Social scientists Theodore Caplow et al. argue that \"\"the Democratic party, nationally, moved from left-center toward the center in the 1940s and 1950s, then moved further toward the right-center in the 1970s and 1980s\"\".\nQuestion: who has won the popular vote but lost the election\nYour answer: ",

Keon was named the playoff's most valuable player, and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy. From 1968 to 1970, the Maple Leafs made it to the playoffs only once. They lost several players to the 1967 expansion drafts, and the team was racked with dissension because of Imlach\u2019s authoritative manner, and his attempts to prevent the players from joining the newly formed Players' Association.\n[2] Title: \"Toronto Maple Leafs\" Text:  From 1961 to 1967, the two teams met one another in three playoff series, including two Stanley Cup finals. Within those 25 years, the Leafs and Red Wings played a total of 15 postseason series including six Cup Finals; the Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings in all six Cup Finals. The teams have only met three times in the postseason since the Original Six-era, with their last meeting in 1993. After the Leafs moved to the Eastern Conference in 1998, they faced each other less often, and the rivalry began to stagnate.\n[3] Title: \"Toronto Maple Leafs\" Text:  In the 1999 playoffs, the team advanced to the Conference Finals, but lost in five games to the Buffalo Sabres.

On April 23, 2017, the Maple Leafs were eliminated from the playoffs by the top-seeded Washington Capitals four games to two in the best-of-seven series. Toronto finished the 2017\u201318 season with 105 points by beating Montreal 4\u20132 in their final game of the regular season, a franchise-record, beating the previous record of 103 points set in 2004.\n[5] Title: \"2002 Stanley Cup playoffs\" Text:  This was the second playoff series between these two teams, with the only previous meeting being the 2001 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals where New Jersey won in six games.

This was the third playoff series between these two teams, the teams split the previous two playoff series. They last met in the 1981 Preliminary Round where New York won in three games.

When the TV contracts were renewed near the end of the season, the rights to broadcast \"\"Monday Night Football\"\" were awarded to Disney-owned corporate sibling ESPN.\n[3] Title: \"Monday Night Football\" Text:  However, the cable-only playoff game experiment would only last one season. On May 11, 2015, it was announced that ABC would simulcast a Wild Card playoff game with ESPN for the 2015 season. This was the first NFL game broadcast nationally on ABC since \"\"MNF\"\" left the network at the end of the 2005 season. The game, announced by the broadcast team of Tirico, Gruden and Salters, was the first of the 2015\u201316 NFL playoffs. The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Houston Texans 30\u20130. The ESPN/ABC simulcast continued for both the 2016 season, and the 2017 season as well.\n[4] Title: \"1998\u201399 NFL playoffs\" Text:  All Dallas could do was avoid a shutout when Deion Sanders' 41-yard punt return set up Aikman's 6-yard touchdown pass to Billy Davis with 3:33 left in the game. It was the last time ABC aired a game between these two teams, after six games on \"\"Monday Night Football\"\". ESPN finally aired a game between these two in 2017 (though they did meet on Sunday night on ESPN once). It was the final home playoff game for the triplets and the last playoff game at Texas Stadium until 2007.\n[5] Title: \"Super Bowl XXIX\" Text:  Also, the trophy presentation for this game was the last to be held in the winning team's locker room, as all subsequent Vince Lombardi Trophy presentations would be held on the field.

The film contends that the U.S. Congress has no control or oversight over the Fed, and hence has no control over the value of U.S. money. The film argues that Congressional control over the value of money is required by Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution. The phrase in question (clause 5) states that the United States Congress shall have the power \"\"To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin...\"\" The film includes a call to action to abolish the Federal Reserve.\n[2] Title: \"Federal Reserve Act\" Text:  In delegating that power, Congress (and, by the 1980s, the Fed itself) lost control over the money supply, the quantity of which determines the value or purchasing power of any unit thereof. Thus, the argument goes, Congress is no longer able to fulfill its constitutional responsibility to the public to regulate the value of our money, the vast majority of which private banks (and, by the 2000s, shadow banks) create through private-interest-bearing debt. Federal Reserve Act The Federal Reserve Act (ch. 6, , enacted December 23, 1913, 12 U.S.C.\n[3] Title: \"Central bank\" Text:  The US Federal Reserve remits all its profits to the U.S. Treasury. This income, derived from the power to issue currency, is referred to as seigniorage, and usually belongs to the national government. The state-sanctioned power to create currency is called the Right of Issuance. Throughout history there have been disagreements over this power, since whoever controls the creation of currency controls the seigniorage income. The expression \"\"monetary policy\"\" may also refer more narrowly to the interest-rate targets and other active measures undertaken by the monetary authority.\n[4] Title: \"Federal Reserve Act\" Text:  Regarding the first question, at issue was not the federal government\u2019s right to coin or originate US money (because the US government had already done so in the past by issuing Greenbacks) and it is a sovereign power and responsibility of Congress stated in the U.S. Constitution (Article 1, Sec.8, Clause 5). Rather, the constitutional issue was and still is that, through the Federal Reserve Act, the federal government purported to delegate its power to create U.S. money to the private banks that comprise the Federal Reserve System.\n[5] Title: \"Legal Tender Cases\" Text:  in federal territories or elsewhere). of the Constitution specifically gives Congress power to \"\"borrow money\"\" and also power to \"\"coin money and regulate the value\"\" of both U.S. and foreign coins, and regulate interstate commerce, but does not explicitly and unambiguously grant Congress the power to print paper money or make it legal tender. The federal government first issued paper money in 1861 to fund the Civil War. Before that, all U.S. paper money was bank-issued money. For example, paper notes were issued by the First Bank of the United States, which was a private corporation chartered by the federal government.\nQuestion: who has the power over the money in the us government\nYour answer: ",

Most of these wars and conflict have ended with defeat or disaster for Pakistan. The Kashmir issue has been the main cause of all major conflicts between the two countries with the exception of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 where conflict originated due to turmoil in erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).\n[2] Title: \"India\u2013Pakistan relations\" Text:  Pakistan later withdrew from the remaining portion under international pressure and high casualties. The relations are locked in other territorial claims such as the Siachen Glacier and Kori Creek. The Indus Waters Treaty governs the rivers that flow from India into Pakistan. Water is cited as one possible cause for a conflict between the two nations, but to date issues such as the Nimoo Bazgo Project have been resolved through diplomacy. In 1949, India recorded close to 1 million Hindu refugees, who flooded into West Bengal and other states from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), owing to communal violence, intimidation and repression from authorities.\n[3] Title: \"India\u2013Pakistan relations\" Text:  Since their Independence, the two countries have fought three major wars, one undeclared war and have been involved in numerous armed skirmishes and military standoffs. The Kashmir conflict is the main centre-point of all of these conflicts with the exception of the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 and Bangladesh Liberation War, which resulted in the secession of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). There have been numerous attempts to improve the relationship\u2014notably, the Shimla summit, the Agra summit and the Lahore summit. Since the early 1980s, relations between the two nations soured particularly after the Siachen conflict, the intensification of Kashmir insurgency in 1989, Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests in 1998 and the 1999 Kargil war.\n[4] Title: \"Kashmir conflict\" Text:  According to former Indian Prime-minister Manmohan Singh, one of the main reasons behind the conflict was Pakistan's \"\"terror-induced coercion\"\". He further stated at a Joint Press Conference with United States President Barack Obama in New Delhi that India is not afraid of resolving all the issues with Pakistan including that of Kashmir \"\"\"\"but it is our request that you cannot simultaneously be talking and at the same time the terror machine is as active as ever before. Once Pakistan moves away from this terror-induced coercion, we will be very happy to engage productively with Pakistan to resolve all outstanding issues.\"\"\"\"\n[5] Title: \"Nuclear proliferation\" Text:  Kashmir is a prime cause of bilateral tension, its sovereignty being in dispute since 1948. There is persistent low level bilateral military conflict due to alleged backing of insurgency by Pakistan in India and infiltration of Pakistani state backed militants in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, along with the disputed status of Kashmir. Both engaged in a conventional arms race in the 1980s, including sophisticated technology and equipment capable of delivering nuclear weapons. In the 1990s the arms race quickened. In 1994 India reversed a four-year trend of reduced allocations for defence, and despite its much smaller economy, Pakistan was expected to push its own expenditures yet higher.\nQuestion: what is the main cause of conflict between india and pakistan\nYour answer: ",

Du Bois\" Text:  Du Bois restated the resolutions of the congress in his \"\"Manifesto To the League of Nations\"\", which implored the newly formed League of Nations to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts. The League took little action on the requests. Another important African-American leader of the 1920s was Marcus Garvey, promoter of the Back-to-Africa movement and founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). Garvey denounced Du Bois's efforts to achieve equality through integration, and instead endorsed racial separatism. Du Bois initially supported the concept of Garvey's Black Star Line, a shipping company that was intended to facilitate commerce within the African diaspora.\n[2] Title: \"Postcolonial literature\" Text:  He founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL). He also founded the Black Star Line, a shipping and passenger line which promoted the return of the African diaspora to their ancestral lands. Prior to the 20th century, leaders such as Prince Hall, Martin Delany, Edward Wilmot Blyden, and Henry Highland Garnet advocated the involvement of the African diaspora in African affairs. However, Garvey was unique in advancing a Pan-African philosophy to inspire a global mass movement and economic empowerment focusing on Africa. The philosophy came to be known as Garveyism.\n[3] Title: \"Culture of Liberia\" Text:  In the end, he is known in world history and on African continent as the genius behind the phrase, \"\"Africa for Africans!\"\" and later inspired Marcus Garvey's Back to Africa Movement. Blyden is a national hero in Liberia. During the 20th century and currently in first decade of the 21st century, other authors have taken a less political but prominent role in Liberian literature. Several authors are renowned for their starling, detailed and deep observation of Liberian life both in the country and abroad in Diaspora in Europe or United States.\n[4] Title: \"Back-to-Africa movement\" Text:  In time, African American Black Loyalists and West Indians would immigrate to the colony of Freetown, Sierra Leone, in smaller numbers in efforts led by black merchants or beneficiaries such as Paul Cuffe. More recently the African-American actor Isaiah Washington, a titled chief of the Mende people, has received Sierra Leonean citizenship due to his ancestral descent from the Mendes. Due to this, other members of the African diaspora that are also of Sierra Leonean descent can apply for citizenship as well if their descent is verified by a DNA test, as Mr. Washington's was.\n[5] Title: \"Back-to-Africa movement\" Text:  The discussion between ACS proponents and anticolonizationists did not stop blacks from migrating to Liberia despite numerous challenges. According to the \"\"Encyclopedia of Georgia History and Culture\"\", \"\"as early as 1820, black Americans had begun to return to their ancestral homeland through the auspices of the American Colonization Society\"\" and by 1847, the American Colonization Society founded Liberia and designated it as the land to be colonized by all black people returning from the United States of America. By the decline of the Back to Africa Movement, the American Colonization Society migrated over 13,000 blacks back to Africa.\nQuestion: which african american led the back to africa movement during the early 20th century\nYour answer: ",

The name is given due to the color of bruising. The so-called black eye is caused by bleeding beneath the skin and around the eye. Sometimes a black eye can worsen if not referred to a doctor if not resolved after a few months, indicating a more extensive injury - potentially even a skull fracture, particularly if the area around both eyes has bruised (raccoon eyes), or if there has been a prior head injury.\n[2] Title: \"Black eye\" Text:  Although most black eye injuries are not serious, bleeding within the eye, called a hyphema, is serious and can reduce vision and damage the cornea. In some cases, abnormally high pressure inside the eyeball (ocular hypertension) can also result. Despite the name, the eye itself is not affected. Blunt force or trauma to the eye socket results in burst capillaries and subsequent haemorrhaging (hematoma). The fatty tissue along with the lack of muscle around the eye socket allows a potential space for blood accumulation. As this blood is reabsorbed, various pigments are released similar to a bruise lending itself to the extreme outward appearance.\n[3] Title: \"Black eye\" Text:  Research has yet to find any evidence of this treatment being effective.

The tissues around the eye are soft and thus bruise easily when pinched against margins of bone which surround the eye socket. The treatment of black eye is the same as that for bruises in other parts of the body \u2013 cold compresses during the first twenty-four hours and contrasting hot and cold thereafter. During the process of healing, a black eye can be made less conspicuous by using cosmetics designed to obscure discolorations of the skin.\n[5] Title: \"Black eye\" Text:  In a severe contusion, blowout of the floor of the orbit may occur, leading to double vision. Such an injury requires surgical correction. A black eye developing after a severe head injury may be a sign of skull fracture. Unless there is actual trauma to the eye itself (see below), extensive medical attention is generally not needed. Applying an ice pack will keep down swelling and reduce internal bleeding by constricting the capillaries. Analgesic drugs (painkillers) can be administered to relieve pain. An anecdotal remedy for a black eye consists of applying raw meat to the eye area.\nQuestion: whats the black part of the eye called\nYour answer: ",

In its original form, it features five songs, four of which are songs by the Velvet Underground. The musicians were Pentti Glan (drums) and Prakash John (bass), Ray Colcord (keyboards), and Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter on guitars. (The two guitarists would later form the basis of the second Alice Cooper band, beginning on \"\"Welcome to My Nightmare\"\", which also features Glan and John.)\n[2] Title: \"Dick Wagner\" Text:  The band toured internationally with Reed, culminating in the \"\"Rock 'n' Roll Animal\"\" album, recorded live at the New York Academy of Music in December 1973. Readers of \"\"Guitar World\"\" ranked the Hunter/Wagner solos on the 1973 live version of \"\"Sweet Jane\"\" 81st among the 100 Greatest Guitar Solos of all time. It was during Wagner's days with the Frost that he first met Alice Cooper. Producer Bob Ezrin brought both Wagner and Steve Hunter into the studio to play guitar on the early Alice Cooper albums.\n[3] Title: \"Rock 'n' Roll Animal\" Text:  So, at the Academy, I didn't expect much and when his new band came out and began to play spectacular, even majestic, rock & roll, management's strategy for the evening became clear: Elevate the erratic and unstable punkiness of the centerpiece into punchy, swaggering grandeur by using the best arrangements, sound and musicians that money could buy; the trimmings, particularly guitarists Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter, were awesome enough so that if Reed were merely competent, the concert would be a success. And it was, as one can judge from the resultant albums.\n[4] Title: \"Lou Reed\" Text:  He played a heavy metal version of Cohen's \"\"The Stranger Song\"\". In December that year, Reed played a series of shows at St. Ann's Warehouse, Brooklyn, based on \"\"Berlin\"\". Reed played with guitarist Steve Hunter, who played on the original album and \"\"Rock 'n' Roll Animal\"\", and was joined by singers Anohni and Sharon Jones. The show was produced by Bob Ezrin, who also produced the original album, and Hal Willner. The show played at the Sydney Festival in January 2007 and in Europe during June and July 2007.\n[5] Title: \"Dick Wagner\" Text:  Her d\u00e9but album, produced by Wagner, was included in the 2007 50th Anniversary Grammy Awards ballot.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Precambrian Text:  The atmosphere of the early Earth is not well understood. Most geologists believe it was composed primarily of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other relatively inert gases, and was lacking in free oxygen. There is, however, evidence that an oxygen-rich atmosphere existed since the early Archean. At present, it is still believed that molecular oxygen was not a significant fraction of Earth's atmosphere until after photosynthetic life forms evolved and began to produce it in large quantities as a byproduct of their metabolism. This radical shift from a chemically inert to an oxidizing atmosphere caused an ecological crisis, sometimes called the oxygen catastrophe.\n[2] Title: \"Atmosphere of Earth\" Text:  The first atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen. There were probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), notably water vapor, methane and ammonia. Outgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids, produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen plus carbon dioxide and inert gases. A major part of carbon-dioxide emissions dissolved in water and reacted with metals such as calcium and magnesium during weathering of crustal rocks to form carbonates that were deposited as sediments.\n[3] Title: Paleoclimatology Text:  As the solar nebula dissipated, the gases would have escaped, partly driven off by the solar wind. The next atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and inert gases, was produced by outgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids. A major part of carbon dioxide emissions were soon dissolved in water and built up carbonate sediments. Water-related sediments have been found dating from as early as 3.8 billion years ago. About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen was the major part of the then stable \"\"second atmosphere\"\".\n[4] Title: \"Atmosphere of Earth\" Text:  Water-related sediments have been found that date from as early as 3.8 billion years ago. About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable \"\"second atmosphere\"\". The influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere, because hints of early life-forms appear as early as 3.5 billion years ago. How Earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out 30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the \"\"faint young Sun paradox\"\".\n[5] Title: \"History of Earth\" Text:  Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago, approximately one-third the age of the universe, by accretion from the solar nebula. Volcanic outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean, but the early atmosphere contained almost no oxygen. Much of the Earth was molten because of frequent collisions with other bodies which led to extreme volcanism. While Earth was in its earliest stage (Early Earth), a giant impact collision with a planet-sized body named Theia is thought to have formed the Moon. Over time, the Earth cooled, causing the formation of a solid crust, and allowing liquid water on the surface.\nQuestion: which gas most likely was not part of earth 's early atmosphere\nYour answer: ",

Consequently, he not only discussed the problem of universals (distinguishing between the abstract, the process, and the concrete\u2014exemplified, for instance, by the Latin words \"\"albedo\"\", \"\"albet\"\", and \"\"album\"\") but also occupied himself with problems of metaphysics and cosmology.\n[4] Title: \"Standing on the shoulders of giants\" Text:  He pointed out that we see more and farther than our predecessors, not because we have keener vision or greater height, but because we are lifted up and borne aloft on their gigantic stature.\"\" According to medieval historian Richard William Southern, Bernard was comparing contemporary 12th century scholars to the ancient scholars of Greece and Rome: [The phrase] sums up the quality of the cathedral schools in the history of learning, and indeed characterizes the age which opened with Gerbert (950\u20131003) and Fulbert (960\u20131028) and closed in the first quarter of the 12th century with Peter Abelard.\n[5] Title: \"Isaac Newton\" Text:  Two writers think that the above quotation, written at a time when Newton and Hooke were in dispute over optical discoveries, was an oblique attack on Hooke (said to have been short and hunchbacked), rather than\u2014or in addition to\u2014a statement of modesty. On the other hand, the widely known proverb about standing on the shoulders of giants, published among others by seventeenth-century poet George Herbert (a former orator of the University of Cambridge and fellow of Trinity College) in his \"\"Jacula Prudentum\"\" (1651), had as its main point that \"\"a dwarf on a giant's shoulders sees farther of the two\"\", and so its effect as an analogy would place Newton himself rather than Hooke as the 'dwarf'.\nQuestion: where does the saying standing on the shoulders of giants come from\nYour answer: ",

A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until the signing of the Treaty of Versailles with Germany on 28 June 1919. The United States Senate did not ratify the treaty despite public support for it, and did not formally end its involvement in the war until the Knox\u2013Porter Resolution was signed on 2 July 1921 by President Warren G. Harding.

The film stars Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka and Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket. The storyline follows Charlie, who wins a contest and, along with four other contest winners, is led by Wonka on a tour of his chocolate factory, the most magnificent in the world. Development for a second adaptation of \"\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"\" (filmed previously as \"\"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\"\" in 1971) began in 1991, which resulted in Warner Bros. providing the Dahl Estate with total artistic control.\n[3] Title: \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)\" Text:  Filming took place from June to December 2004 at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom. \"\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"\" was released to positive critical reception and was a box office success, grossing $475 million worldwide. Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a poor boy who lives near the Wonka Candy Company.

To win any part of a pot if more than one player has a hand, a player must show all of his cards faceup on the table, whether they were used in the final hand played or not. Cards speak for themselves: the actual value of a player's hand prevails in the event a player mis-states the value of his hand.\n[2] Title: \"Showdown (poker)\" Text:  To speed up the game, a player holding a probable winner is encouraged to show the hand without delay. Any player who has been dealt in may request to see any hand that is eligible to participate in the showdown, even if the hand has been mucked. This option is generally only used when a player suspects collusion or some other sort of cheating by other players. When the privilege is abused by a player (i.e. the player does not suspect cheating, but asks to see the cards just to get insight on another player's style or betting patterns), he may be warned by the dealer, or even removed from the table.\n[3] Title: \"Betting in poker\" Text:  This may not be the case, and would result in the player having to bet twice to cover preceding raises, which would cause confusion. A player is never required to expose their concealed cards when folding or if all others have folded; this is only required at the showdown. Many casinos and public cardrooms using a house dealer require players to protect their hands. This is done either by holding the cards or, if they are on the table, by placing a chip or other object on top. Unprotected hands in such situations are generally considered folded and are mucked by the dealer when action reaches the player.\n[4] Title: \"Betting in poker\" Text:  Some casinos and many major tournaments require that all players still involved open, or immediately reveal, their hole cards in this case\u2014the dealer will not continue dealing until all hands are flipped up. Likewise, any other cards that would normally be dealt face down, such as the final card in seven-card stud, may be dealt face-up. Such action is automatic in online poker. This rule discourages a form of tournament collusion called \"\"chip dumping\"\", in which one player deliberately loses their chips to another to give that player a greater chance of winning.\n[5] Title: Poker Text:  Between rounds, the players' hands develop in some way, often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt. At the end of each round, all bets are gathered into the central pot. At any time during a betting round, if one player bets, no opponents choose to \"\"call\"\" (match) the bet, and all opponents instead \"\"fold\"\", the hand ends immediately, the bettor is awarded the pot, no cards are required to be shown, and the next hand begins.\nQuestion: when do you have to show your cards in poker\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Mesothelium Text:  Mesothelium The mesothelium is a membrane composed of simple squamous epithelium that forms the lining of several body cavities: the pleura (thoracic cavity), peritoneum (abdominal cavity including the mesentery), mediastinum and pericardium (heart sac). Mesothelial tissue also surrounds the male internal reproductive organs (the tunica vaginalis testis) and covers the internal reproductive organs of women (the tunica serosa uteri). Mesothelium that covers the internal organs is called visceral mesothelium, while the layer that covers the body walls is called the parietal mesothelium. Mesothelium is the epithelial component of serosa.\n[2] Title: \"Serous membrane\" Text:  Serous membranes line and enclose several body cavities, known as serous cavities, where they secrete a lubricating fluid which reduces friction from muscle movement. Serosa is entirely different from the adventitia, a connective tissue layer which binds together structures rather than reducing friction between them. The serous membrane covering the heart and lining the mediastinum is referred to as the pericardium, the serous membrane lining the thoracic cavity and surrounding the lungs is referred to as the pleura, and that lining the abdominopelvic cavity and the viscera is referred to as the peritoneum.\n[3] Title: \"Serous membrane\" Text:  For the heart, the layers of the serous membrane are called the parietal pericardium, and the visceral pericardium (sometimes called the epicardium). Other parts of the body may also have specific names for these structures. For example, the serosa of the uterus is called the perimetrium. The pericardial cavity (surrounding the heart), pleural cavity (surrounding the lungs) and peritoneal cavity (surrounding most organs of the abdomen) are the three serous cavities within the human body. While serous membranes have a lubricative role to play in all three cavities, in the pleural cavity it has a greater role to play in the function of breathing.\n[4] Title: Heart Text:  They include MYH6, ACTC1, TNNI3, CDH2 and PKP2. Other proteins expressed are MYH7 and LDB3 that are also expressed in skeletal muscle. The pericardium is the sack that surrounds the heart. The tough outer surface of the pericardium is called the fibrous membrane. This is lined by a double inner membrane called the serous membrane that produces pericardial fluid to lubricate the surface of the heart. The part of the serous membrane attached to the fibrous membrane is called the parietal pericardium, while the part of the serous membrane attached to the heart is known as the visceral pericardium.\n[5] Title: Heart Text:  Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band. The left ventricle pumps blood to the body through the aortic valve and into the aorta. Two small openings above the aortic valve carry blood to the heart itself, the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery. The heart wall is made up of three layers: the inner endocardium, middle myocardium and outer epicardium. These are surrounded by a double-membraned sac called the pericardium.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Industrial warfare\" Text:  The first use of airplanes in war was the Italo-Turkish War of 1911, when the Italians carried out several reconnaissance and bombing missions. During WWI both sides made use of balloons and airplanes for reconnaissance and directing artillery fire. To prevent enemy reconnaissance, some airplane pilots began attacking other airplanes and balloons, first with small arms carried in the cockpit, and later with machine guns mounted on the aircraft. Both sides also made use of aircraft for bombing, strafing and dropping of propaganda leaflets. The German air force carried out the first terror bombing raids, using Zeppelins to drop bombs on Britain.\n[2] Title: \"History of aerial warfare\" Text:  The first use of airplanes in an actual war occurred in the 1911 Italo-Turkish War with Italian Army Air Corps Bl\u00e9riot XI and Nieuport IV monoplanes bombing a Turkish camp at Ain Zara, Libya. In the First Balkan War (1912) the Bulgarian Air Force bombed Turkish positions at Adrianople, while the Greek Aviation performed, over the Dardanelles, the first naval air co-operation mission in history. Airplanes were also used by the United States Army against Pancho Villa. Air reconnaissance was carried out in both wars too. The air-dropped bomb was extensively used during the First Balkan War (including in the first night bombing on 7 November 1912), and subsequently used by the Imperial German Air Service during World War I.\n[3] Title: \"Early flying machines\" Text:  Aeroplanes were first used in warfare during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911\u20131912. The first operational use took place on 23 October 1911, when Captain Carlo Piazza made a flight near Benghazi in a Bl\u00e9riot XI. The first aerial bombardment followed shortly afterwards on 1 November, when Second Lieutenant Giulio Gavotti dropped four bombs on two oases held by the Turks. The first photographic reconnaissance flight took place in March 1912, also flown by Captain Piazza. Some types developed during this period would see military service into, or even throughout, World War I.\n[4] Title: \"History of aviation\" Text:  The first mission (a reconnaissance) occurred on 23 October 1911. The first bombing mission was flown on 1 November 1911. Then Bulgaria followed this example. Its airplanes attacked and reconnoitered the Ottoman positions during the First Balkan War 1912\u201313. The first war to see major use of airplanes in offensive, defensive and reconnaissance capabilities was World War I. The Allies and Central Powers both used airplanes and airships extensively. While the concept of using the airplane as an offensive weapon was generally discounted before World War I, the idea of using it for photography was one that was not lost on any of the major forces.\n[5] Title: \"Military aviation\" Text:  The use of lighter-than-air aircraft in warfare became prevalent in the 19th century, including regular use in the American Civil War. Lighter-than-air military aviation persisted until shortly after World War II, gradually being withdrawn from various roles as heavier-than-air aircraft improved. Heavier-than-air aircraft were recognized as having military applications early on, despite resistance from traditionalists and the severe limitations of early aircraft. The U.S. Army Signal Corps purchased a Wright Model A on 2 August 1909 which became the first military aircraft in history. In 1911, the Italians used a variety of aircraft types in reconnaissance, photo-reconnaissance, and bombing roles during the Italo-Turkish War.\nQuestion: when was the first airplane used in war\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Anglo-Saxon pound\" Text:  Thomas Snelling writes that the division of the pound into 12 ounces was in use with the Romans, and the division of ounces into 20 pennyweights was introduced into France by Charlemagne, and then brought to England by William the Conqueror. The Latin word for \"\"pound\"\" is libra. The \u00a3 or \u20a4 is a stylised writing of the letter L, a short way of writing libra. This is similar to how a pound of mass is abbreviated \"\"lb\"\". Up until 1972, especially on typewriters or keyboards without a \"\"\u00a3\"\" symbol, it was common to write \"\"L\"\" or \"\"l\"\" instead of \"\"\u00a3\"\".\n[2] Title: \"Pound (mass)\" Text:  The First Schedule of the Act gave more details of the standard pound: it is a platinum cylinder nearly high, and diameter, and the edges are carefully rounded off. It has a groove about from the top, to allow the cylinder to be lifted using an ivory fork. It was constructed following the destruction of the Houses of Parliament by fire in 1834, and is stamped P.S. 1844, 1 lb (P.S. stands for \"\"Parliamentary Standard\"\"). This definition of the Imperial pound remains unchanged.\n[3] Title: \"Canal pound\" Text:  Summit pounds are particularly important in canal design, as every boat entering or leaving the pound causes a loss of water. Summit pounds therefore need an independent form of water supply, which may take the form of weirs on adjacent rivers, reservoirs or pumping stations. Common practice during canal design was to make summit pounds as large as practically possible, in order that losing a lockful of water would not lower the water level too significantly. The Rochdale Canal is a good example of a canal with a relatively short summit pound, which requires restrictions on lock workings at certain times.\n[4] Title: \"Canal pound\" Text:  Because the maximum level in the pound is normally controlled by a bywash weir at the lower lock, some of the water from the upper lock may be lost over it, and if the lower lock has a deeper fall, there is a net loss of level when a boat passes through the pound. A side pound is a particular type of extremely short lock pound, which is extended sideways to make up for the short distance between locks so as to avoid excessive level fluctuations. An example of this is the Caen Hill locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal.\n[5] Title: \"Rochdale Canal\" Text:  A branch from Heywood to Castleton opened in 1834. As a result of having no summit tunnel, there were more locks, and the summit pound was very short, at just . To the north and east, 36 locks descended to Sowerby Bridge, while to the south and west, another 56 locks descended to Castlefield Junction, on the edge of Manchester. The summit pound is above sea level, and is one of the highest summit pounds in Britain. Blackstone Edge Reservoir, covering and Chelburn Reservoir, covering , were the first two reservoirs built to supply the water for all these locks.\nQuestion: why is the short form of pounds lbs\nYour answer: ",

The objective of the attacking American forces was consolidation of the U.S. beachheads (Utah Beach and Omaha Beach) and establishment of a continuous defensive line against expected German counterattacks. The defending German force attempted to hold the city long enough to allow reinforcements en route from the south to arrive, prevent or delay the merging of the lodgments, and keep the U.S. First Army from launching an attack towards Lessay-P\u00e9riers that would cut off the Cotentin Peninsula.\n[2] Title: \"Military history of the United States during World War II\" Text:  By the end of the day, the Americans suffered over 6,000 casualties.

Early on June 7 WN-69 defending St. Laurent was abandoned and the 115th Infantry Regiment was therefore able to push inland to the south-west, reaching the Formigny area on June 7 and the original D-Day phase line the following day. The third regiment of 29th Division; the 175th, started landing on June 7.

It was released December 3, 1985 and recorded the day after their only loss of the season at the hands of the Miami Dolphins, two months prior to their win in Super Bowl XX. It peaked at No. 41 in February 1986 on the \"\"Billboard\"\" Hot 100 chart. The 1985 rap hit recorded by the players of the Chicago Bears known as the \u201cSuper Bowl Shuffle\u201d instantly became a mainstream phenomenon.\n[2] Title: \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\" Text:  \u201cThe Super Bowl Shuffle\u201d fell in line with the Bears high-media attention as they completed their one-loss regular season. The Bears dominated their playoff opponents including the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl, 46\u201310. The 1985 Chicago Bears were the first sports team to have their own rap video.

The 1985 team is also remembered for recording the song \"\"The Super Bowl Shuffle\"\", which reached number forty-one on the \"\"Billboard\"\" Hot 100 and was nominated for a Grammy Award.

The song's popularity led to it being #41 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and the song funded $300,000 in profit for the Chicago Community Trust to help needy families in Chicago with clothing, shelter, and food, hence Walter Payton's rap lyric: \"\"now we're not doing this because we're greedy, the Bears are doing it to feed the needy\"\".\n[5] Title: \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\" Text:  Lyrics written by Richard E. Meyer and Melvin Owens. Music composed by Bobby Daniels and Lloyd Barry. The \"\"Referee\"\" in the video was portrayed by Julia Kallish. Bears defensive end Dan Hampton declined involvement with the Shuffle, thinking it may have been too arrogant. The 1985 Bears were not the first pro football team with a group song.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Federal government of the United States\" Text:  Federal government of the United States The Federal Government of the United States (U.S. Federal Government) is the national government of the United States, a federal republic in North America, composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and several island possessions. The federal government is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive, and judicial, whose powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the Congress, the President, and the federal courts, respectively. The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the Supreme Court.\n[2] Title: \"Federal government of the United States\" Text:  One of the theoretical pillars of the U.S. Constitution is the idea of \"\"checks and balances\"\" among the powers and responsibilities of the three branches of American government: the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary. For example, while the legislative branch (Congress) has the power to create law, the executive branch under the president can veto any legislation\u2014an act which, in turn, can be overridden by Congress. The president nominates judges to the nation's highest judiciary authority, the Supreme Court, but those nominees must be approved by Congress.\n[3] Title: \"Limited government\" Text:  The three branches\u2014legislative, executive, and judicial\u2014 compete with each other through certain powers that allow them to \u201ccheck\u201d the others and \u201cbalance\u201d the government. Examples of this include the legislative branch's power to override Presidential Vetoes and the judicial branch's power to declare laws created by the legislative branch unconstitutional. James Madison writes in Federalist No. 51 \u201cBut the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department, the necessary constitutional means, and personal motives, to resist encroachments of the others.\u201d Without the capacity of each branch to check the others, power would concentrate with a small minority and could potentially allow the minority to infringe upon the rights of the people.\n[4] Title: \"Concurrent majority\" Text:  One protection was separation of powers, such as bicameralism in the US Congress and the three branches of the national government: legislative, executive, and judicial. Having two houses was intended to serve as a brake on popular movements that might threaten particular groups, with the US House of Representatives representing the common people and the US Senate defending the interests of the state governments. The House was to be elected by popular vote, and the Senate was to be chosen by state legislatures. The executive veto and the implied power of judicial review, which was later made explicit by the US Supreme Court, created further obstacles to absolute majority rule.\n[5] Title: \"United States Congress\" Text:  Representative Lee H. Hamilton explained how Congress functions within the federal government: To me the key to understanding it is balance. The founders went to great lengths to balance institutions against each other\u2014balancing powers among the three branches: Congress, the president, and the Supreme Court; between the House of Representatives and the Senate; between the federal government and the states; among states of different sizes and regions with different interests; between the powers of government and the rights of citizens, as spelled out in the Bill of Rights ...

Carmella won the match that caused much controversy because none of the women climbed the ladder and took the briefcase.\n[3] Title: \"Money in the Bank ladder match\" Text:  McMahon then scheduled the five to compete in the first-ever women's Money in the Bank ladder match at the event where the winner would receive a contract for a SmackDown Women's Championship match.

After a fall at the MS Gala, Phyllis needed brain surgery, but was never able to tell Jack that Sharon had switched the results and Nick was really Summer's father before she slipped into a coma.\n[4] Title: \"Jack Abbott (The Young and the Restless)\" Text:  Victor believes Nikki Newman is behind the publication, and divorces her. He marries Leanna, which is later declared invalid. Victor eventually returns to Nikki, and gains reigns over Jabot Cosmetics. Victor fires Jack and replaces him with Brad Carlton. In response, Jack spitefully marries Nikki, who is again estranged from Victor. Problems arise early in Jack and Nikki's marriage, and Nikki soon develops addictions to painkillers and alcohol. Following an argument with Victor, Nikki's child, to be named John Abbott III, is stillborn.\n[5] Title: \"Jack Abbott (The Young and the Restless)\" Text:  Jack's plan to bargain for the company by using Nikki backfires when he falls for her.

A relatively minor holiday in Mexico, in the United States Cinco de Mayo has evolved into a commemoration of Mexican culture and heritage, particularly in areas with large Mexican-American populations. Many Americans mistakenly believe that Cinco de Mayo (\u201cMay 5th\u201d) is the Mexican equivalent of the United States\u2019 Fourth of July holiday \u2014 a date marking the official casting off of colonial rule via the announcement of a new independent country.\n[2] Title: \"Fiestas Patrias (Mexico)\" Text:  Contrary to common misconception in the U.S., \"\"Cinco de mayo\"\" is not Mexico's \"\"Independence Day\"\", but rather commemorates an initial victory of Mexican forces over French forces in the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. In contrast to Independence Day, described above, \"\"Cinco de mayo\"\" is observed mostly at a local level (Puebla State) and is a minor Bank Holiday in the rest of Mexico. Many labor unions have negotiated to have the day off, however, since its proximity to Labor Day (May 1) often allows an extended five-day weekend or two consecutive three-day weekends.\n[3] Title: \"Battle of Puebla\" Text:  Its celebration is regional in Mexico, primarily in the state of Puebla, where the holiday is celebrated as \"\"El D\u00eda de la Batalla de Puebla\"\" (English: The Day of the Battle of Puebla). There is some limited recognition of the holiday in other parts of the country. In the United States, this holiday has evolved into the very popular Cinco de Mayo holiday, a celebration of Mexican heritage. The 1858\u201360 Mexican civil war (known as The Reform War) had caused major distress throughout Mexico's economy.\n[4] Title: \"Battle of Puebla\" Text:  A common misconception in the United States is that Cinco de Mayo is Mexico's Independence Day, the most important national patriotic holiday in Mexico. Mexico celebrates Independence Day on the 16th of September, commemorating the beginning of the war of Independence (September 16, 1810, the \"\"Cry of Dolores\"\"). Mexico also observes the culmination of the war of Independence, which lasted 11 years, on the 27th of September. Since the 1930s, a re-enactment of the Battle of Puebla has been held each year at Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de los Ba\u00f1os, a rocky outcrop close to Mexico City International Airport.\n[5] Title: Puebla Text:  However, the Mexican version of Independence Day is celebrated on September 16, for it was on that date in 1810 that the commencement of the war for Mexican independence from Spanish rule was pronounced in the small town of Dolores by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla (an event now referred to as the \u201cGrito de Dolores\u201d \u2014 \u201cCry of Dolores\u201d \u2014 or \u201cEl Grito de la Independencia\u201d).

McFerrin has also worked in collaboration with instrumentalists, including pianists Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, and Joe Zawinul, drummer Tony Williams, and cellist Yo-Yo Ma.

The song's success \"\"ended McFerrin's musical life as he had known it,\"\" and he began to pursue other musical possibilities on stage and in recording studios. The song was used in George H. W. Bush's 1988 U.S. presidential election as Bush's 1988 official presidential campaign song, without Bobby McFerrin's permission or endorsement. In reaction, Bobby McFerrin publicly protested that particular use of his song, including stating that he was going to vote against Bush, and completely dropped the song from his own performance repertoire, to make the point even clearer.\n[5] Title: \"Bobby McFerrin\" Text:  As early as 1992, widespread rumors circulated that falsely claimed McFerrin committed suicide.

The designer tie style is still prominent amongst contemporary fashion designers, such as Louis Feraud, Timothy Everest, Duchamp and Paul Smith and Patrick McMurray. In 1925 Patou launched his perfume business with three fragrances created by Henri Alm\u00e9ras. In 1928, Jean Patou created \"\"Huile de Chald\u00e9e\"\", the first sun tan lotion.\n[2] Title: \"Culture of the United Kingdom\" Text:  Particularly during the Victorian era, British fashions defined acceptable dress for men of business. Key figures such as the future Edward VII, Edward VIII, and Beau Brummell, created the modern suit and cemented its dominance. Brummell is credited with introducing and establishing as fashion the modern man's suit, worn with a tie. The use of a coloured and patterned tie (a common feature in British school uniforms) indicating the wearer's membership in a club, regiment, school, professional association etc. stems from the 1880 oarsmen of Exeter College, Oxford, who tied the bands of their straw hats around their necks.\n[3] Title: \"White tie\" Text:  It also continued to evolve. White tie was worn with slim-cut trousers in the early 1920s; by 1926, wide-lapelled tailcoats and double-breasted waistcoats were in vogue. The Duke of Windsor (then Prince of Wales and later Edward VIII) wore a midnight blue tailcoat, trousers and waistcoat in the 1920s and 1930s both to \"\"soften\"\" the contrast between black and white and allow for photographs to depict the nuances of his tailoring. The late 1920s and 1930s witnessed a resurgence in the dress code's popularity, but by 1953, one etiquette writer stressed that \"\"The modern trend is to wear 'tails' only for the most formal and ceremonious functions, such as important formal dinners, balls, elaborate evening weddings, and opening night at the opera\"\".\n[4] Title: \"White tie\" Text:  In modern times this is rarely seen. However, if worn, the knee-length cassock is now replaced with normal dress trousers. Throughout the Early Modern period, western European male courtiers and aristocrats donned elaborate clothing at ceremonies and dinners: coats (often richly decorated), frilly and lacy shirts and breeches formed the backbone of their most formal attire. As the 18th century drew to a close, high society began adopting more austere clothing which drew inspiration from the dark hues and simpler designs adopted by country gentlemen. By the end of the 18th century, two forms of tail coat were in common use by upper class men in Britain and continental Europe: the more formal dress coat (cut away horizontally at the front) and the less formal morning coat, which curved back from the front to the tails.\n[5] Title: \"1860s in Western fashion\" Text:  These rich ties were tied below the chin in a bow or left untied to show off the beautiful print or material. Bonnets fell out of fashion over the decade in favor of small hats. Men's fashion of the 1860s remained much the same as in the previous decade. Shirts of linen or cotton featured high upstanding or turnover collars, and neckties grew wider and were tied in a bow or looped into a loose knot and fastened with a stickpin. Heavy padded and fitted frock coats (in French redingotes), now usually single-breasted and knee length, were worn for business occasions, over waistcoats or vests with lapels and notched collars.\nQuestion: when did the modern tie come into fashion\nYour answer: ",

The Niger takes one of the most unusual routes of any major river, a boomerang shape that baffled geographers for two centuries. Its source is just 240 km (150 mi) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, but the river runs directly away from the sea into the Sahara Desert, then takes a sharp right turn near the ancient city of Timbuktu (Tombouctou) and heads southeast to the Gulf of Guinea.\nQuestion: where did river niger and river benue meet\nYour answer: ",

In 1962, he became the first African-American student admitted to the segregated University of Mississippi, after the intervention of the federal government, an event that was a flashpoint in the Civil Rights Movement. Inspired by President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address, Meredith decided to exercise his constitutional rights and apply to the University of Mississippi. His goal was to put pressure on the Kennedy administration to enforce civil rights for African Americans.\n[2] Title: \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\" Text:  \"\"Oxford Town\"\" is Dylan's sardonic account of events at the University of Mississippi in September 1962. U.S. Air Force veteran James Meredith was the first black student to enroll at the University of Mississippi, located a mile from Oxford, Mississippi. When Meredith first tried to attend classes at the school, some Mississippians pledged to keep the university segregated, including the state governor Ross Barnett. Ultimately, the University of Mississippi had to be integrated with the help of U.S. federal troops. Dylan responded rapidly: his song was published in the November 1962 issue of \"\"Broadside\"\".\n[3] Title: \"James Meredith\" Text:  On the evening of September 29, after State Senator George Yarbrough withdrew the State Highway Police, a riot broke out the following day.

In the violent clashes which followed, two men were killed by gunshot wounds, and the white mob burned cars, pelted federal marshals with rocks, bricks and small arms fire, and damaged university property.

It was accompanied by a new drive to register African Americans to vote in Mississippi. In this latter goal, it succeeded in registering between 2,500 and 3,000 black Mississippians to vote. The march ended on June 26 after Meredith, who had been wounded by a sniper's bullet earlier on the march, addressed a large rally of some 15,000 people in Jackson.\nQuestion: who was the first black student admitted to the university of mississippi\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Communism Text:  According to Richard Pipes, the idea of a classless, egalitarian society first emerged in Ancient Greece. The 5th-century Mazdak movement in Persia (Iran) has been described as \"\"communistic\"\" for challenging the enormous privileges of the noble classes and the clergy, for criticizing the institution of private property and for striving to create an egalitarian society. At one time or another, various small communist communities existed, generally under the inspiration of Scripture. For example, in the medieval Christian church some monastic communities and religious orders shared their land and their other property (see religious and Christian communism).\n[2] Title: Communism Text:  Criticism of the idea of private property continued into the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century through such thinkers as Jean Jacques Rousseau in France. Later, following the upheaval of the French Revolution communism emerged as a political doctrine. In the early 19th century, various social reformers founded communities based on common ownership. However, unlike many previous communist communities they replaced the religious emphasis with a rational and philanthropic basis. Notable among them were Robert Owen, who founded New Harmony in Indiana (1825), as well as Charles Fourier, whose followers organized other settlements in the United States such as Brook Farm (1841\u20131847).\n[3] Title: \"History of communism\" Text:  In Europe, during the early modern period various groups supporting communist ideas appeared. Tommaso Campanella's 1601 work \"\"The City of the Sun\"\" propagated the concept of a society where the products of society should be shared equally. Within a few centuries, during the English Civil War various groups on the side of the Roundheads propagated the redistribution of wealth on an egalitarian basis, namely the Levellers and the Diggers. In the 18th century, the French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau in his hugely influential \"\"The Social Contract\"\" (1762) outlined the basis for a political order based on popular sovereignty rather than the rule of monarchs.\n[4] Title: \"History of communism\" Text:  His views proved influential during the French Revolution of 1789 in which various anti-monarchists, particularly the Jacobins, supported the idea of redistributing wealth equally among the people, including Jean-Paul Marat and Gracchus Babeuf. The latter was involved in the Conspiracy of the Equals of 1796 intending to establish a revolutionary regime based on communal ownership, egalitarianism and the redistribution of property. However, the plot was detected and he and several others involved were arrested and executed. Despite this setback, the example of the French Revolutionary regime and Babeuf's doomed insurrection was an inspiration for radical French thinkers such as Compte Henri de Saint Simon, Louis Blanc, Charles Fourier and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who declared that \"\"Property is theft!\"\".\n[5] Title: \"History of communism\" Text:  By the 1830s and 1840s the egalitarian concepts of communism and the related ideas of socialism had become widely popular in French revolutionary circles thanks to the writings of social critics and philosophers such as Pierre Leroux and Th\u00e9odore D\u00e9zamy whose critiques of bourgeoisie liberalism led to a widespread intellectual rejection of laissez-faire capitalism on both economic, philosophical, and moral grounds. Importantly one of Babeuf's co-conspirators, Philippe Buonarroti, survived the crackdown on the Conspiracy of the Equals, and went on to write the influential book \"\"Babuef's Conspiracy for Equality\"\" first published in 1828.\nQuestion: who came up with the idea of communism\nYour answer: ",

HAL speaks in a soft, calm voice and a conversational manner, in contrast to the crewmen, David Bowman and Frank Poole. In the film \"\"2001\"\", HAL became operational on 12 January 1992 at the HAL Laboratories in Urbana, Illinois as production number 3. The activation year was 1991 in earlier screenplays and changed to 1997 in Clarke's written and released in conjunction with the movie.\n[2] Title: \"2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)\" Text:  A mission, \"\"Discovery One\"\", is dispatched to Saturn. En route, Dr. David Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole are the only conscious humans aboard; their three colleagues are in suspended animation, to be awakened near Saturn. The HAL 9000, an artificially intelligent computer, addressed as \"\"Hal\"\", maintains the ship. While Poole is receiving a birthday message from his family on Earth, Hal tells Bowman that the AE-35 communication unit of the ship is going to malfunction. Poole takes one of the extra-vehicular pods and swaps the AE-35 unit; but when Bowman conducts tests on the removed AE-35 unit, he determines that there was never anything wrong with it.\n[3] Title: \"2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)\" Text:  Poole and Bowman become suspicious at Hal's refusal to admit that his diagnosis was mistaken; Hal then claims that the replacement AE-35 unit will fail. In communicating with Earth, Poole and Bowman are directed to disconnect Hal for analysis. These instructions are interrupted as the signal is broken, and Hal informs them that the AE-35 unit has malfunctioned. As Poole is removing the unit he is killed when his pod accelerates into him, crushing him. Bowman, uncertain of Hal's role therein, decides to wake the other three astronauts, and therefore quarrels with Hal, with Hal refusing to obey his orders.\n[4] Title: \"2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)\" Text:  In the novel it is during the birthday message to Frank Poole. In the film, Bowman and Poole decide \"\"on their own\"\" to disconnect HAL in context of a plan to restore the allegedly failing antenna unit. If it does not fail, HAL will be shown to be malfunctioning. HAL discovers the plan by reading their lips through the EVA pod window. In Clarke's novel, \"\"ground control\"\" orders Bowman and Poole to disconnect HAL, should he prove to be malfunctioning a second time by predicting that the second unit is going to go bad.\n[5] Title: \"2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)\" Text:  Clarke went on to replace Saturn with Jupiter in the novel's sequel \"\"\"\". Trumbull later developed a more convincing image of Saturn for his own directorial debut \"\"Silent Running\"\". The general sequence of the showdown with HAL is different in the film from in the book. HAL's initial assertion that the AE-35 unit will fail comes in the film after an extended conversation with David Bowman about the odd and \"\"melodramatic\"\" \"\"mysteries\"\" and \"\"secrecy\"\" surrounding the mission, motivated officially because HAL is required to draw up and send to Earth a crew psychology report.\nQuestion: what did hal stand for in 2001 a space odyssey\nYour answer: ",

He also was an actor, most notably on the TV series \"\"Fame\"\", where he played Benjamin Shorofsky, the music teacher. It was a part he originated in the film of the same name.\n[4] Title: \"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! The Musical\" Text:  The original production was remounted in again in 1995 and 1998 playing to sold-out houses every time. The musical was performed at the Old Globe Theatre, San Diego, where it has run every Christmas season since 1998. The Old Globe production was directed by Jack O'Brien. This version featured songs from the television special, which had music by Albert Hague and lyrics by Seuss. A then-unknown Vanessa Anne Hudgens played Cindy Lou Who (1998\u20131999).

This effect can be seen more easily in the example of two carts being pushed up opposite sides of a hill.

At the same time, Gibbs designed a chapel of ease for the 1st Earl of Oxford, now known as St Peter, Vere Street (1721\u201324). In 1725 he designed All Saints', Derby, now Derby Cathedral, on similar lines to St Martin's, although at Derby the original gothic steeple was retained. Gibbs, the first British architect to do so, created numerous designs for funeral monuments, often collaborating with the sculptor Michael Rysbrack.\n[2] Title: \"James Gibbs\" Text:  He was the first British architect to publish a book devoted to his own designs. The major works illustrated include St Martin-in-the-Fields (including the unexecuted version with a circular nave), St Mary le Strand, the complete schemes for King's College Cambridge and the Public Building (including the Senate House) at Cambridge University, numerous designs for medium-sized country houses, garden building and follies, obelisks and memorial columns, church memorials and monuments, as well as wrought-iron work, fireplaces, window and door surrounds, Cartouche (design) and urns.\n[3] Title: \"St Martin-in-the-Fields\" Text:  In designing the church, Gibbs drew upon the works of Christopher Wren, but departed from Wren's practice in his integration of the tower into the church. Rather than considering it as an adjunct to the main body of the building, he constructed it within the west wall, so that it rises above the roof, immediately behind the portico, an arrangement also used at around the same time by John James at St George, Hanover Square (completed in 1724), although James' steeple is much less ambitious. The spire of St Martin's rises above the level of the church floor.\n[4] Title: \"St Martin-in-the-Fields\" Text:  The design was criticised widely at the time, but subsequently became extremely famous, being copied particularly widely in the United States. In Britain, the design of the 1830s St Andrew's in the Square church in Glasgow was inspired by it. In India, St. Andrew's Church, Egmore, Madras (now Chennai), is modelled on St Martin-in-the-Fields. In South Africa, the Dutch Reformed Church in Cradock is modelled on St Martin-in-the-Fields. Various notables were soon buried in the new church, including the \u00e9migr\u00e9 sculptor Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Roubiliac (who had settled in this area of London) and the furniture-maker Thomas Chippendale (whose workshop was in the same street as the church, St Martin's Lane), along with Jack Sheppard in the adjoining churchyard.\n[5] Title: Greding Text:  The site is now occupied by a fountain. The current town hall building was erected in 1699 and is thought to be the work of the Eichst\u00e4tt architect Jakob Engel. The fa\u00e7ade is decorated with the arms of the lord of the estate, Prince Bishop Johann Martin von Eyb (1697\u20131704). This predominantly 12th-century church stands on a hill overlooking the town and is a conspicuous local landmark. St Martins is the largest Romanesque basilica in the former diocese of Eichst\u00e4tt. It was consecrated by Bishop Otto (1182\u20131196). The late gothic altar dates from 1480 and is flanked by rococo figures of the Virgin Mary and St John from around 1780.\nQuestion: scottish architect who developed st martins in the field\nYour answer: ",

A remake of the 1933 film of the same name, the film stars Naomi Watts, Jack Black, Adrien Brody, and, through motion capture, Andy Serkis as the title character. Set in 1933, \"\"King Kong\"\" tells the story of an ambitious filmmaker who coerces his cast and hired ship crew to travel to the mysterious Skull Island. There they encounter Kong, a legendary giant gorilla, whom they capture and take to New York City.\n[2] Title: \"Carl Denham\" Text:  Carl Denham Carl Denham is a fictional character in the films \"\"King Kong\"\" and \"\"The Son of Kong\"\" (both released in 1933), as well as in the 2005 remake of \"\"King Kong\"\", and a 2004 illustrated novel titled \"\"Kong: King of Skull Island\"\". The role was played by Robert Armstrong in the 1933 films and by Jack Black in the 2005 remake. Denham's function in the story is to initiate the action by bringing the characters to Skull Island, where they encounter the giant beast Kong.\n[3] Title: \"Peter Jackson's King Kong\" Text:  Many of the Kong sequences fulfill the role of boss fights, as the giant ape is able to effectively battle the gigantic creatures that Jack's weapons cannot harm. In 1933, film director Carl Denham (Jack Black), has gotten hold of a mysterious map, which reveals the secret location of a large island known as Skull Island, a place located in the far reaches of the Indian Ocean (correctly the Pacific Ocean in the game). Carl hires playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) to write his script and plucks a starving, out-of-work actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) to play the part of leading lady and a tramp steamer called the \"\"Venture\"\" to take them to the island.\n[4] Title: \"Jack Driscoll\" Text:  Jack Driscoll Jack Driscoll is a fictional character in the \"\"King Kong\"\" franchise. In the original 1933 film he was the first mate of the ship named the \"\"Venture\"\", while in its 2005 remake he was a playwright (the less faithful 1976 remake had an analogous character named Jack Prescott, played by Jeff Bridges). He was played by Bruce Cabot in the original and by Adrien Brody in the remake. In both versions he is one of the main heroes of the story, a man who is on a ship heading for the mysterious Skull Island where Carl Denham intends to make a film.\n[5] Title: \"Jack Driscoll\" Text:  On the way, Driscoll falls in love with the actress, Ann Darrow, and when she is kidnapped by a giant ape on the island named Kong, Driscoll rescues her after helping to lead a search. Beyond these facts, even his characterization is quite different in the two films. Driscoll is a supporting character in \"\"Kong: King of Skull Island\"\", an \"\"authorized\"\" illustrated-novel that continues the Kong story in 1957. Driscoll is also a playable character in the video game \"\"\"\", along with Kong himself.\nQuestion: who played king kong in kong skull island\nYour answer: ",

It has been a holder of a Royal Warrant from Elizabeth II since 1955. Cadbury merged with J. S. Fry & Sons in 1919, and Schweppes in 1969, known as Cadbury Schweppes until 2008, when the American beverage business was split as Dr Pepper Snapple Group; the rights ownership of the Schweppes brand had already differed between various countries since 2006.

The season two set, therefore contains 17 episodes. Season three contains 13 episodes, two of which did not originally air on television. All 28 episodes that aired as part of season four, remain intact for the season four set and the same for the 13-episode season five set. The first four seasons were released in box set format, with two smaller-than-standard size DVD cases with a slipcover for each of the four sets.\n[2] Title: \"Grounded for Life\" Text:  17 episodes were produced for season two, with the addition of the five season one episodes, making it a 22-episode season. Many problems occurred during the production of season three. 19 episodes had been produced for season three, and with Fox cancelling the series later being picked up by The WB, only 11 episodes aired through the two networks, 12 & 13 never aired, and episodes 14 through 19, were included as part of season four.

Season two began airing in the United States on October 4, 2007, and featured 15 episodes. The second season was originally intended to consist of 22 episodes, but the order was cut to 15 due to the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike. The season finale aired on May 8, 2008.

Jesse Alexander, co-producer and writer, explained that this process was important in a serialized drama because one has to know where each character's development is heading. Season two coincided with the WGA writers' strike, meaning only 11 out of the planned 24 episodes were produced. This forced the producers to redesign the season to encompass only the \"\"Generations\"\" volume out of the three planned. The planned third volume, \"\"Exodus\"\", which was originally designed to be a story arc reflecting the effects of the release of strain 138 of the Shanti virus, was cancelled.\n[5] Title: \"The 4400\" Text:  Seasons two, three and four are each 13-episode seasons (counting the two hour premiers in seasons two and three as two episodes).

The Board of County Commissioners may create municipalities, special taxing districts and other boards or authorities as needed. The Home Rule Charter for Miami-Dade County was adopted by referendum on May 21, 1957. This predates the 1968 revision to the Florida Constitution, which radically altered home rule. On November 13, 1997 voters changed the name of the county from Dade to Miami-Dade to acknowledge the international name recognition of Miami.\n[2] Title: \"Government of Miami-Dade County\" Text:  Government of Miami-Dade County The Government of Miami-Dade County is defined and authorized under the Constitution of Florida, Florida law, and the Home Rule Charter of the County of Miami-Dade. Since its formation in 1957, Miami-Dade County, Florida has had a two-tier system of government. Under this system, Miami-Dade comprises a large unincorporated area and 35 incorporated areas or municipalities.

The fact that Crockett and Tubbs were Dade County officers and not City of Miami police represented the growing notion of metro government in Miami. In 1997, a county referendum changed the name from Dade County to Miami-Dade County. This allowed people to relate the county government to recognized notions and images of Miami, many of which were first popularized by \"\"Miami Vice\"\". The Dade County Sheriff's Office now became the Miami-Dade Police Department.\n[5] Title: \"Miami-Dade Police Department\" Text:  In July 1981, the Public Safety Department was renamed the Metro-Dade Police Department. In September 1997, voters decided to change the jurisdiction's name to Miami-Dade County. In December of the same year, the Metro-Dade Police Department was renamed the Miami-Dade Police Department. On September 13, 2007 four Miami-Dade Police Department officers were shot by a suspect with an AK-47, resulting in the death of one officer, Jose Somohano.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Wormian bones\" Text:  Wormian bones Wormian bones, also known as intrasutural bones or sutural bones, are extra bone pieces that can occur within a suture (joint) in the skull. These are irregular isolated bones that can appear in addition to the usual centres of ossification of the skull and, although unusual, are not rare. They occur most frequently in the course of the lambdoid suture, which is more tortuous than other sutures. They are also occasionally seen within the sagittal and coronal sutures. A large wormian bone at lambda is often called an Inca bone (Os Incae), due to the relatively high frequency of occurrence in Peruvian mummies.\n[2] Title: \"Wormian bones\" Text:  Wormian bones are named for Ole Worm, professor of anatomy at Copenhagen, 1588\u20131654. He taught Latin, Greek, physics and medicine. His description of the extra-sutural bones contributed to the science of embryology. Wormian bones Wormian bones, also known as intrasutural bones or sutural bones, are extra bone pieces that can occur within a suture (joint) in the skull. These are irregular isolated bones that can appear in addition to the usual centres of ossification of the skull and, although unusual, are not rare. They occur most frequently in the course of\n[3] Title: Skull Text:  The neurocranium (or \"\"braincase\"\") forms the protective cranial cavity that surrounds and houses the brain and brainstem. The upper areas of the cranial bones form the calvaria (skullcap). The membranous viscerocranium includes the mandible. The facial skeleton is formed by the bones supporting the face. Except for the mandible, all of the bones of the skull are joined together by sutures\u2014synarthrodial (immovable) joints formed by bony ossification, with Sharpey's fibres permitting some flexibility. Sometimes there can be extra bone pieces within the suture known as wormian bones or \"\"sutural bones\"\".\n[4] Title: \"Fibrous joint\" Text:  In fetal skulls the sutures are wide to allow slight movement during birth. They later become rigid (synarthrodial). Some of the long bones in the body such as the radius and ulna in the forearm are joined by a syndesmosis (along the interosseous membrane). Syndemoses are slightly moveable (amphiarthrodial). The distal tibiofibular joint is another example. A gomphosis is a joint between the root of a tooth and the socket in the maxilla or mandible (jawbones). A suture is a type of fibrous joint that is only found in the skull.\n[5] Title: \"Fibrous joint\" Text:  In old age, cranial sutures may ossify (turn to bone) completely. The joints between the teeth (gomphoses) and the joint between the mandible and the cranium, the temporomandibular joint, form the only non-sutured joints in the skull. Most sutures are named for the bones they articulate, but some have special names of their own. A syndesmosis is a slightly movable fibrous joint in which bones such as the tibia and fibula are joined together by connective tissue. Examples include the distal tibia fibular joint as well as the radioulnar joint.\nQuestion: what is an example of a sutural bone\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Presidency Text:  In the United States, the impeachment process begins in the House of Representatives, where the president is first accused of committing either bribery, treason, or other high crimes including misdemeanors. If the House passes a majority vote to impeach the president, the Senate then conducts the trial to remove them from office. If a president is found guilty, he is removed from office and replaced by the vice president for the remainder of the term. If the president is acquitted in court, he will continue to serve the rest of their term as president.\n[2] Title: \"Presidential system\" Text:  A prominent example of such an accession would be the elevation of Vice President Gerald Ford to the U.S. Presidency after Richard Nixon agreed to resign in the face of virtually certain impeachment and removal, a succession that took place notwithstanding the fact that Ford had only assumed the Vice Presidency after being appointed by Nixon to replace Spiro Agnew, who had also resigned due to scandal. In some cases, particularly when the would-be successor to a presidency is seen by legislators as no better (or even worse) than a president they wish to see removed, there may be a strong incentive to abstain from pursuing impeachment proceedings even if there are legal grounds to do so.\n[3] Title: \"Presidential system\" Text:  Furthermore, even when impeachment proceedings against a sitting president are successful, whether by causing his removal from office or by compelling his resignation, the legislature usually has little or no discretion in determining the ousted president's successor, since presidential systems usually adhere to a rigid succession process which is enforced the same way regardless of how a vacancy in the presidency comes about. The usual outcome of a presidency becoming vacant is that a vice president automatically succeeds to the presidency. Vice presidents are usually chosen by the president, whether as a running mate who elected alongside the president or appointed by a sitting president, so that when a vice president succeeds to the presidency it is probable that he will continue many or all the policies of the former president.\n[4] Title: \"President of Croatia\" Text:  The president decides on the revocation of this authority and his return to the office. If the president is prevented from performing his duties for a longer period of time due to illness or other form of incapacitation, and especially if the president is unable to decide on a transfer of powers to a deputy, the Speaker of the parliament becomes the acting president, assuming presidential duty pursuant to a decision of the Constitutional Court, made upon request of the Government. In case of death or resignation submitted to the President of the Constitutional Court and communicated to the Speaker of the parliament, or in cases when the Constitutional Court decides to terminate the presidential term through impeachment, the Speaker of the parliament becomes acting president.\n[5] Title: \"President of Turkey\" Text:  The president may be impeached for high treason on the proposal of at least one-third of the total number of the members of the parliament, and by the decision of at least three-fourths of the total number of the members. In the event of a temporary absence of the President on account of illness, travel abroad or similar circumstances, the Vice President of Turkey serves as Acting President, and exercises the powers of the President until the Presidents comes back. If the Presidents resigns or dies, the TBMM Speaker serves as Acting President, and exercises the powers of the President until the new election happens in 45 days.\nQuestion: who becomes the president after the president is impeached\nYour answer: ",

Henry William Sydney Porter (September 11, 1862 \u2013 June 5, 1910), better known by his pen name O. Henry, was an American short story writer. His stories are known for their surprise endings. William Sidney Porter was born on September 11, 1862, in Greensboro, North Carolina. He changed the spelling of his middle name to Sydney in 1898. His parents were Dr. Algernon Sidney Porter (1825\u201388), a physician, and Mary Jane Virginia Swaim Porter (1833\u201365). William's parents had married on April 20, 1858.\n[2] Title: \"O. Henry\" Text:  He gave various explanations for the origin of his pen name. In 1909 he gave an interview to \"\"The New York Times\"\", in which he gave an account of it: William Trevor writes in the introduction to \"\"The World of O. Henry: Roads of Destiny and Other Stories\"\" (Hodder & Stoughton, 1973) that \"\"there was a prison guard named Orrin Henry\"\" in the Ohio State Penitentiary \"\"whom William Sydney Porter ... immortalised as O. Henry\"\". According to J. F. Clarke, it is from the name of the French pharmacist Etienne Ossian Henry, whose name is in the \"\"U.S. Dispensary\"\" which Porter used working in the prison pharmacy.\n[3] Title: \"O. Henry\" Text:  His final work was \"\"Dream\"\", a short story intended for the magazine \"\"The Cosmopolitan\"\" but left incomplete at the time of his death. Among his most famous stories are: Porter used a number of pen names (including \"\"O. Henry\"\" or \"\"Olivier Henry\"\") in the early part of his writing career; other names included S.H. Peters, James L. Bliss, T.B. Dowd, and Howard Clark. Nevertheless, the name \"\"O. Henry\"\" seemed to garner the most attention from editors and the public, and was used exclusively by Porter for his writing by about 1902.\n[4] Title: \"O. Henry\" Text:  He had 14 stories published under various pseudonyms while he was in prison but was becoming best known as \"\"O. Henry\"\", a pseudonym that first appeared over the story \"\"Whistling Dick's Christmas Stocking\"\" in the December 1899 issue of \"\"McClure's Magazine\"\". A friend of his in New Orleans would forward his stories to publishers so that they had no idea that the writer was imprisoned. Porter was released on July 24, 1901, for good behavior after serving three years. He reunited with his daughter Margaret, now age 11, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Athol's parents had moved after Porter's conviction.\n[5] Title: \"O. Henry\" Text:  Writer and scholar Guy Davenport offers his own hypothesis: \"\"The pseudonym that he began to write under in prison is constructed from the first two letters of \"\"Ohio\"\" and the second and last two of \"\"penitentiary\"\".\"\" The O. Henry Award is a prestigious annual prize named after Porter and given to outstanding short stories. A film was made in 1952 featuring five stories, called \"\"O. Henry's Full House\"\".

In some languages, the tilde is used as a diacritical mark ( \u02dc ) placed over a letter to indicate a change in pronunciation, such as nasalization. It was first used in the polytonic orthography of Ancient Greek, as a variant of the circumflex, representing a rise in pitch followed by a return to standard pitch.\n[2] Title: \"Spanish orthography\" Text:  An accent over the high vowel ( or ) of a vowel sequence prevents it from being a diphthong (i.e., it signals a hiatus): for example, and have two syllables each. A word with final stress is called oxytone (or in traditional Spanish grammar texts); a word with penultimate stress is called paroxytone ( or ); a word with antepenultimate stress (stress on the third-to-last syllable) is called proparoxytone (). A word with preantepenultimate stress (on the fourth last syllable) or earlier does not have a common linguistic term in English, but in Spanish receives the name .\n[3] Title: \"Spanish orthography\" Text:  Stress in Spanish is marked unequivocally through a series of orthographic rules. The default stress is on the penultimate (next-to-last) syllable on words that end in a vowel, or and on the final syllable when the word ends in any consonant other than or . Words that do not follow the default stress have an acute accent over the stressed vowel. The written accent will thus appear only in certain forms of a word and not others, for example \"\"and\u00e9n\"\", plural \"\"andenes\"\". In many cases the accent is essential to understanding what a word means, for example hablo (I speak) as opposed to habl\u00f3 (he/she/Ud.\n[4] Title: \"Spanish language\" Text:  Under the orthographic conventions, a typical Spanish word is stressed on the syllable before the last if it ends with a vowel (not including ) or with a vowel followed by or an ; it is stressed on the last syllable otherwise. Exceptions to this rule are indicated by placing an acute accent on the stressed vowel. The acute accent is used, in addition, to distinguish between certain homophones, especially when one of them is a stressed word and the other one is a clitic: compare ('the', masculine singular definite article) with ('he' or 'it'), or ('you', object pronoun) with ('tea'), (preposition 'of') versus ('give' [formal imperative/third-person present subjunctive]), and (reflexive pronoun) versus ('I know' or imperative 'be').\n[5] Title: \"Spanish orthography\" Text:  \"\"franc\u00e9s\"\", \"\"espa\u00f1ol\"\", \"\"israel\u00ed\"\" from \"\"Francia\"\", \"\"Espa\u00f1a\"\", and \"\"Israel\"\", respectively) and book titles capitalize only the first word (e.g. \"\"La rebeli\u00f3n de las masas\"\"). Spanish uses only the acute accent, over any vowel: .

The level of popularity it attained is remarkable given there was still much resentment of Japan in Australia at the time, although it may be explained by the fact that most of the fans were children and teenagers. The program proved so popular that a promoter brought out star Ose Koichi and a large supporting troupe to appear in a specially written 90-minute stage play based on the show, which played to capacity houses in both at the Sydney Stadium and Melbourne, and it was reported that more people (over 7,000, many of them in costume) turned out to greet Ose when he arrived at Essendon Airport in Melbourne than greeted The Beatles when they visited there in June 1964.\n[5] Title: \"Ninja Senshi Tobikage\" Text:  Ninja Senshi Tobikage , known as Ninja Robots in English releases, is a Japanese anime television series, produced by Studio Pierrot, which aired from 6 October 1985 to 13 July 1986 on the Nippon Television network.

It is based on the idea/thought that something as conspicuous as an elephant can appear to be overlooked in codified social interactions, and that the sociology/psychology of repression also operates on the macro scale. In 1814, Ivan Andreevich Krylov (1769\u20131844), poet and fabulist, wrote a fable entitled \"\"The Inquisitive Man\"\" which tells of a man who goes to a museum and notices all sorts of tiny things, but fails to notice an elephant.\n[2] Title: \"Elephant in the room\" Text:  It means \"\"truth we all know but agree not to talk about.\"\" Elephant in the room \"\"Elephant in the room\"\" is an English-language metaphorical idiom for an obvious problem or risk that no one wants to discuss. It is based on\n[3] Title: \"Elephant in the room\" Text:  The idiom can imply a value judgment that the issue ought to be discussed openly, or it can simply be an acknowledgment that the issue is there and not going to go away by itself. The term is often used to describe an issue that involves a social taboo, such as race, religion, homosexuality, mental illness, or even suicide. It is applicable when a subject is emotionally charged; and the people who might have spoken up decide that it is probably best avoided. The idiom is commonly used in addiction recovery terminology to describe the reluctance of friends and family of an addicted person to discuss the person's problem, thus aiding the person's denial.\n[4] Title: \"Elephant in the room\" Text:  In 1935, comedian Jimmy Durante starred on Broadway in the Billy Rose Broadway musical \"\"Jumbo\"\", in which a police officer stops him while leading a live elephant and asks, \"\"What are you doing with that elephant?\"\" Durante's reply, \"\"What elephant?\"\" was a regular show-stopper. Durante reprises the piece in the 1962 film version of the play, \"\"Billy Rose's Jumbo\"\". The term refers to a question, problem, solution, or controversial issue which is obvious to everyone who knows about the situation, but which is deliberately ignored because to do otherwise would cause great embarrassment, sadness, or arguments, or is simply taboo.\n[5] Title: \"Elephant in the room\" Text:  The phrase became proverbial. Fyodor Dostoevsky in his novel \"\"Demons\"\" wrote, 'Belinsky was just like Krylov's Inquisitive Man, who didn't notice the elephant in the museum...' The \"\"Oxford English Dictionary\"\" gives the first recorded use of the phrase, as a simile, in \"\"The New York Times\"\" on June 20, 1959: \"\"Financing schools has become a problem about equal to having an elephant in the living room.

Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, \"\"God Bless America\"\" is commonly sung during the seventh-inning stretch in Major League Baseball games, most often on Sundays, Opening Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, All-Star Game, Labor Day, September 11, and all post-season Major League Baseball games.\n[2] Title: \"Seventh-inning stretch\" Text:  Following the September 11 attacks, \"\"God Bless America\"\" became common during the seventh-inning stretch, sometimes in addition to \"\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\"\" and sometimes replacing it entirely. Some stadiums play \"\"God Bless America\"\" only on Sundays. At Yankee Stadium the song is now played at every game, in addition to \"\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\"\". Since 2002, \"\"God Bless America\"\" has been performed at all Major League Baseball All-Star Games and playoff games in the United States, often with a celebrity recording artist or a member of the United States Armed Forces (\"\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\"\" is sometimes done afterwards with a recording of Harry Caray), as well as Opening Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, and September 11.\n[3] Title: \"Baseball rules\" Text:  However, since the September 11, 2001 attacks, \"\"God Bless America\"\" has often been added to it, especially at games in New York City and Washington, D.C., as well as during the All-Star Game and the postseason. In Atlanta and Baltimore it has been a tradition since 1974 to play \"\"Thank God I'm A Country Boy\"\" after \"\"Take Me Out To The Ballgame\"\" during the seventh-inning stretch. At Boston's Fenway Park, a tradition has brought the singing of \"\"Sweet Caroline\"\" in the middle of the eighth inning.\n[4] Title: \"Yankee Stadium (1923)\" Text:  After the September 11 attacks, all American Major League Baseball stadiums started playing God Bless America during the seventh-inning stretch for the remainder of the 2001 season. Many teams ceased this practice the following season, although it has continued in post-season events at many cities and become a tradition at Yankee Stadium alongside \"\"Take Me Out to the Ballgame.\"\" Usually, a recording of the song by Kate Smith is played, although sometimes there is a live performance by Irish tenor Ronan Tynan. For part of the 2005 season, the Yankees used a recording of Tynan, but the Kate Smith version was reinstated due to fan complaints about the long duration of the Tynan version.\n[5] Title: \"God Bless America\" Text:  During major games (playoff contests, Opening Day, national holidays, or games against Boston or the Mets), the Yankees will often have Irish tenor Ronan Tynan perform the song. On August 26, 2008, at a Boston Red Sox game at Yankee Stadium, a fan who had attempted to leave for the restroom during the playing of the song was restrained and subsequently sent out of the building by NYPD officers.

The former Soviet Union and China suffered the most casualties. Estimates place deaths in the Soviet Union at around 23 million, while China suffered about 10 million. No country lost a greater portion of its population than Poland: approximately 5.6 million, or 16%, of its pre-war population of 34.8 million died. The Holocaust (which roughly means \"\"burnt whole\"\") was the deliberate and systematic murder of millions of Jews and other \"\"unwanted\"\" during World War II by the Nazi regime in Germany.\n[2] Title: \"World War II casualties\" Text:  The losses listed here are actual deaths; hypothetical losses due to a decline in births are not included with the total dead. The distinction between military and civilian casualties caused directly by warfare and collateral damage is not always clear-cut. For nations that suffered huge losses such as the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Germany, and Yugoslavia, sources can give only the total estimated population loss caused by the war and a rough estimate of the breakdown of deaths caused by military activity, crimes against humanity and war-related famine.

The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people (mostly civilians) during the war, about half of all World War II casualties. By the end of World War II, Europe had more than 40 million refugees.\n[5] Title: \"Eastern Front (World War II)\" Text:  After the war, following the Yalta conference agreements between the Allies, the German populations of East Prussia and Silesia were displaced to the west of the Oder\u2013Neisse line, in what became one of the largest forced migrations of people in world history. The Soviet Union came out of World War II militarily victorious but economically and structurally devastated. Much of the combat took place in or close by populated areas, the actions of both sides contributed to massive loss of civilian life and tremendous material damage.

The Battle of Munda, which occurred March 17, 45 BC in Hispania, would have occurred between episodes #10 and #11, although it is not mentioned in the series. It was the last military action in \"\"Caesar's Civil War\"\", and the end of the Optimates military opposition to Caesar. The only other man to be granted such sweeping powers over Rome \u2013 at least while it was still a Republic \u2013 was Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix, who used the power to turn the Republic into a bloodbath.\n[4] Title: \"Julius Caesar\" Text:  On his way to Pontus, Caesar visited Tarsus from 27 to 29 May 47 BC (25\u201327 May), where he met enthusiastic support, but where, according to Cicero, Cassius was planning to kill him at this point. Thence, he proceeded to Africa to deal with the remnants of Pompey's senatorial supporters. He quickly gained a significant victory in 46 BC over Cato, who then committed suicide. After this victory, he was appointed dictator for 10 years. Pompey's sons escaped to Spain; Caesar gave chase and defeated the last remnants of opposition in the Battle of Munda in March 45 BC.\n[5] Title: \"Battle of Ilerda\" Text:  Battle of Ilerda The Battle of Ilerda took place in June 49 BC between the forces of Julius Caesar and the Spanish army of Pompey the Great, led by his legates Lucius Afranius and Marcus Petreius. Unlike many other of the battles of the civil war, this was more a campaign of manoeuvre than actual fighting. After having driven the Optimates from Italy, in March 49 BC Caesar turned his attention to the Republican army in the Spanish provinces.

Dylan, who wrote the song, and Manuel, whose falsetto rendition had made the song famous on \"\"Music from Big Pink\"\", shared lead vocals, although Manuel cannot be clearly seen in the film and switched between his normal and falsetto voices between verses.\n[4] Title: \"Richard Manuel\" Text:  The concert was filmed in 35 mm by Robertson confederate and longtime Band fan Martin Scorsese for the documentary \"\"The Last Waltz\"\". Manuel can be heard, but barely seen, singing \"\"I Shall Be Released,\"\" surrounded by guest stars. While Manuel's famed sense of humor and warm, congenial nature emerged in the interview segments, so did his shyness, deferential attitude \u2013 and inebriation. Initially the group only intended to end live performances as The Band, and each member was initially kept on a retainer of $2,500 per week by Warner Brothers.\n[5] Title: \"Bobby Charles\" Text:  Charles did, however, appear briefly in a segment of the released film\u2014in the concert's final song, \"\"I Shall Be Released\"\". In that segment, his image is largely blocked from view during the performance. That song, sung by Bob Dylan and pianist Richard Manuel, featured backup vocals from the entire ensemble, including Charles. He co-wrote the song \"\"Small Town Talk\"\" with Rick Danko of the Band. \"\"Promises, Promises (The Truth Will Set You Free)\"\" was co-written with Willie Nelson.\nQuestion: who sang i shall be released the band\nYour answer: ",

Moses was then given the Ten Commandments by God as Guidance and as Mercy. Meanwhile, in his absence, a man named Samiri had created a Golden Calf, proclaiming it to be the God of Moses. The people began to worship it. Aaron attempted to guide them away from the Golden Calf, but the Israelites refused to do so until Moses had returned. Moses, having thus received the scriptures for his people, was informed by God that the Israelites had been tested in his absence and they had gone astray by worshiping the Golden Calf.\n[2] Title: \"Kingdom of David\" Text:  God gave them to Moses in a face-to-face meeting. The revolution in the Ten Commandments was that God cared about how human beings treated each other. One honors God by treating well the person standing in front of him. The commandments were viewed as a legal contract where God will bless an individual if the individual would follow His rules. After Sinai, all the stories of the Israelites would be whether or not they had obeyed God's commandments. Archeologist feel, through the study of pottery fragments, that the Israelites did not invade Canaan, but were really Canaanites themselves.\n[3] Title: \"Va'etchanan\" Text:  Moses stood between God and them to convey God's words to them, for they were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain. A closed portion (, \"\"setumah\"\") ends here. God said the Ten Commandments: In the fifth reading (, \"\"aliyah\"\"), God spoke these words to the whole congregation at the mountain, with a mighty voice out of the fire and the dense clouds, and God inscribed them on two stone tablets, which God gave to Moses.\n[4] Title: \"Ten Commandments\" Text:  \"\"And he wrote on the tablets, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the gave them unto me.\"\" According to Jewish tradition, constitutes God's first recitation and inscription of the ten commandments on the two tablets, which Moses broke in anger with his rebellious nation, and were later rewritten on replacement stones and placed in the ark of the covenant; and consists of God's re-telling of the Ten Commandments to the younger generation who were to enter the Promised Land.\n[5] Title: \"Ki Tissa\" Text:  The Mishnah taught that the two Tablets of the Ten Commandments that God gave Moses in were among ten things that God created on the eve of the first Sabbath at twilight. Rabbi Meir taught that the stone Tablets that God gave Moses in were each 6 handbreadths long, 6 handbreadths wide, and 3 handbreadths thick. Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish (Resh Lakish) taught that the Torah that God gave Moses was of white fire and its writing of black fire.

Initially producing 235 hp/500 lb-ft of torque, the engine was retuned in 2001. Versions equipped with an automatic transmission produced 250 hp while manual-transmission examples produced 275 hp; with either transmission, the engine produced 525 lb-ft of torque. As the 7.3L V8 was no longer able to comply with emissions regulations for diesel engines, it was discontinued midway through the 2003 model year. As a running change during the 2003 model year, the 6.0L PowerStroke V8 was introduced as the replacement for the previous 7.3L V8 in LHD markets supplied with the American-assembled trucks while RHD ones supplied from Brazil kept the 7.3 until 2005.\n[2] Title: \"Ford Power Stroke engine\" Text:  Aftermarket springs and shims are available to solve the problem however. Besides those minor things, the engine came with forged connecting rods (good for 600hp) until 2001 they went to PMR's (powdered metal rods) which were plenty strong for a stock motor but if there was alot of aftermarket parts, they were a weak link at about 450hp and up. Some early models were fortunate enough to even be sold off the lot without a catylic convertor as emissions didn't quite effect the diesel industry too much yet. The 7.3L DI Power Stroke was in production until the second quarter of model year 2003 when it was replaced by the 6.0L because of its inability to meet newer emission requirements.\n[3] Title: \"Ford Power Stroke engine\" Text:  Nearly 2 million 7.3s were produced from International's Indianapolis plant. The 7.3L DI Power Stroke engine is commonly referred to as one of the best engines that International produced. The 7.3L (444 CID) Power Stroke was replaced by the 6.0L (365 CID) beginning in the second quarter of the 2003 model year. The 6.0L Power Stroke, was used in Ford Super Duty trucks until the 2007 model year but lasted until 2009 in the Ford Econoline vans (model year 2010) and in the Ford Excursion SUVs until after the 2005 models when Ford discontinued Excursion production.\n[4] Title: \"Navistar T444E engine\" Text:  Navistar T444E engine The Navistar T444E is a Diesel V8 engine manufactured by Navistar International Corporation. In its use in Ford Motor Company trucks, vans and school buses, it is the first of the PowerStroke family of diesel engines. The T444E was manufactured from 1994 to 2004, replacing the 7.3 L IDI V8 designed by International Harvester. As a result of federal emission standards, the T444E was discontinued midway through the 2003 model year, replaced by the all-new 6.0 L VT365. In total, nearly 2 million 7.3 L PowerStroke V8s were manufactured for Ford at their Indianapolis, Indiana plant before switching to the 6.0L.\n[5] Title: \"Navistar International\" Text:  Dodge started using a Cummins six-cylinder in 1988. In 1994, when the International 7.3 L IDI V8 was replaced by the T444E, the diesel option was branded \"\"Ford PowerStroke\"\" to emphasize the switch to direct injection. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Ford offered International/Navistar V8 (as the DT inline-6 was far too large to package in a pickup truck) in the Ford Super Duty pickup trucks. As of 2010, the 6.4 L Ford PowerStroke V8 was the last of the International/Navistar diesels used in Ford's F-Series Super Duty lineup.\nQuestion: when did ford quit making the 7.3 diesel\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Computer code\" Text:  Computer code Computer code or program code is the set of instructions forming a computer program which is executed by a computer. It is one of two components of the software which runs on computer hardware, the other being the data. Computers can only directly execute the machine code instructions which are part of their instruction set. Because these instructions are difficult for humans to read, and writing good programs in machine code or other low-level programming languages is a time-consuming task, most programmers write in the source code of a high-level programming language.\n[2] Title: \"Machine code\" Text:  Machine code Machine code is a computer program written in machine language instructions that can be executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task, such as a load, a store, a jump, or an ALU operation on one or more units of data in CPU registers or memory. Machine code is a strictly numerical language which is intended to run as fast as possible, and may be regarded as the lowest-level representation of a compiled or assembled computer program or as a primitive and hardware-dependent programming language.\n[3] Title: \"Central processing unit\" Text:  Hardwired into a CPU's circuitry is a set of basic operations it can perform, called an instruction set. Such operations may involve, for example, adding or subtracting two numbers, comparing two numbers, or jumping to a different part of a program. Each basic operation is represented by a particular combination of bits, known as the machine language opcode; while executing instructions in a machine language program, the CPU decides which operation to perform by \"\"decoding\"\" the opcode. A complete machine language instruction consists of an opcode and, in many cases, additional bits that specify arguments for the operation (for example, the numbers to be summed in the case of an addition operation).\n[4] Title: \"Machine code\" Text:  Instructions are patterns of bits that by physical design correspond to different commands to the machine. Thus, the instruction set is specific to a class of processors using (mostly) the same architecture. Successor or derivative processor designs often include all the instructions of a predecessor and may add additional instructions. Occasionally, a successor design will discontinue or alter the meaning of some instruction code (typically because it is needed for new purposes), affecting code compatibility to some extent; even nearly completely compatible processors may show slightly different behavior for some instructions, but this is rarely a problem.\n[5] Title: \"Instruction set architecture\" Text:  Architectures with even less complexity have been studied, such as the minimal instruction set computer (MISC) and one instruction set computer (OISC). These are theoretically important types, but have not been commercialized. Machine language is built up from discrete \"\"statements\"\" or \"\"instructions\"\". On the processing architecture, a given instruction may specify: More complex operations are built up by combining these simple instructions, which are executed sequentially, or as otherwise directed by control flow instructions. Examples of operations common to many instruction sets include: Processors may include \"\"complex\"\" instructions in their instruction set.\nQuestion: built-in set of machine code instructions of computer are called\nYour answer: ",

Roth originally wanted Cerina Vincent to show her naked buttocks during her sex scene with Rider Strong. Vincent, who had previously played a nude foreign exchange student in \"\"Not Another Teen Movie\"\" (2001), was afraid that exposing too much of herself would lead to being typecast as a nudity actress and vehemently refused to bare her buttocks. At the peak of this conflict between the two, Vincent told Roth that if he wanted the shot so badly, he would need to re-cast the role with another actress.\n[2] Title: \"Cabin Fever (2002 film)\" Text:  But they managed to reach a compromise, in which Vincent showed one inch of her buttocks on camera before Roth measured it for it to be precise. Bedsheets were then taped to her backside at the designated level and the scene was filmed. Composer Angelo Badalamenti agreed to compose some musical themes for the film out of enthusiasm for the material. However, the bulk of the film's score was composed by Nathan Barr. Some of the music selected for the film was deliberately chosen by Roth for their connection to other horror films; in the opening scene for example, while the main characters are driving to the cabin, \"\"The Road Leads to Nowhere\"\", a song written and recorded for \"\"The Last House on the Left\"\" (1972), is playing on the radio.\n[3] Title: \"Scott Hampton\" Text:  It's his loose adaptation of a 21-page comic piece that he worked on and appeared by the same name in the \"\"Hellraiser\"\" comic series.

Because he was not a member of the Directors Guild of America, however, his request was denied by the producers and he remains credited as the film's director.

Australia was a key player and signatory to the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights (1948) The Constitution of Australia (1900) does offer very limited protection of rights: Certain High Court interpretations of the Constitution have allowed for implied rights such as freedom of speech and the right to vote to be established, however others such as freedom of assembly and freedom of association are yet to be identified.\n[2] Title: \"Human rights in Australia\" Text:  Universal voting rights and rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of religion and freedom from discrimination are protected in Australia. The Australian colonies were among the first political entities in the world to grant male (1850s) and female suffrage (1890s). Contemporary Australia is a liberal democracy and heir to a large post-World War II multicultural program of immigration in which forms of racial discrimination have been prohibited. As a founding member of the United Nations, Australia assisted in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and it is signatory to various other international treaties on the subject of human rights.\n[3] Title: \"Human rights in Australia\" Text:  In addition, there are various common law principles which afford certain protections, such as legal professional privilege, and the privilege against self-incrimination. Australia has signed various international treaties and conventions regarding human rights. Australia has agreed to be bound by the following treaties: Although Australia is a signatory to these, the rights given in the treaties are only applicable in Australia if domestic legislation is established. For example, the \"\"Racial Discrimination Act\"\" 1975 (Cth), implements the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and the \"\"Sex Discrimination Act\"\" 1984 (Cth), provides some of the rights outlined in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.\n[4] Title: \"Human rights in Australia\" Text:  The policy was dismantled by successive governments after World War II, and from the 1970s successive governments officially supported multiculturalism. Australia is a signatory to the Refugee Convention and a component of the Australian immigration program is devoted to providing protection for refugees. The majority of refugees received by Australia are identified and referred by the UNHCR. The Special Humanitarian Program further offers refuge to people subject to \"\"substantial discrimination amounting to gross violation of human rights in their home country\"\" and who are supported by a proposer within Australia. In 2009\u201310 a total of 13,770 visas were granted under these categories.\n[5] Title: \"Culture of Australia\" Text:  The Commonwealth of Australia was founded in 1901, after a series of referenda conducted in the British colonies of Australasia. The Australian Constitution established a federal democracy and enshrined human rights such as sections 41 (right to vote), 80 (right to trial by jury) and 116 (freedom of religion) as foundational principles of Australian law and included economic rights such as restricting the government to acquiring property only \"\"on just terms\"\". The Australian Labor Party was established in the 1890s and the Liberal Party of Australia in 1944, both rising to be the dominant political parties and rivals of Australian politics, though various other parties have been and remain influential.\nQuestion: when did australia sign the declaration of human rights\nYour answer: ",

This name comes from Sanskrit which refers \"\"krttik\u00e3\"\" the same star cluster. In ancient Javanese this brightest seven stars are known as \"\"Lintang Wuluh\"\", literally means \"\"seven stars\"\". This star cluster is so popular because its emergence into the sky signals the time marker for planting. In South Korea, the constellation is referred to as \"\"the seven stars of the north\"\".

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Eugenius Text:  The reign of Eugenius marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new one. Five months later Theodosius died, dividing his empire between his two sons. This had happened many times before in the previous two centuries, but this time it was to be final \u2013 the Roman Empire never reunited, even under Leo I the Thracian (when there was no Western Emperor for some periods), and soon after his reign, the western half fell. Eugenius also represented the last opportunity for the pagans, with the senatorial class, to oppose the Christianization of the Empire.\n[2] Title: \"Alaric I\" Text:  Theodosius died in 395, leaving the Empire to be divided between his two sons Arcadius and Honorius, the former taking the eastern and the latter the western portion of the Empire. Arcadius showed little interest in ruling, leaving most of the actual power to his Praetorian Prefect Rufinus. Honorius was still a minor; as his guardian, Theodosius had appointed the \"\"magister militum\"\" Stilicho. Stilicho also claimed to be the guardian of Arcadius, causing much rivalry between the western and eastern courts. According to Edward Gibbon in \"\"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\"\", during the shifting of offices that took place at the beginning of the new reigns, Alaric apparently hoped he would be promoted from a mere commander to the rank of general in one of the regular armies.\n[3] Title: \"Western Roman Empire\" Text:  Again Theodosius I won, and he briefly ruled a united Empire until his death in 395. He was the last Emperor to rule both parts of the Roman Empire before the West fragmented and collapsed. Theodosius I's older son Arcadius inherited the eastern half while the younger Honorius got the western half. Both were still minors and neither was capable of ruling effectively. Honorius was placed under the tutelage of the half-Roman/half-barbarian \"\"magister militum\"\" Flavius Stilicho, while Rufinus became the power behind the throne in the east. Rufinus and Stilicho were rivals, and their disagreements would be exploited by the Gothic leader Alaric I who again rebelled in 408 following the massacre by Roman legions of thousands of barbarian families who were trying to assimilate into the Roman empire.\n[4] Title: \"History of Istanbul\" Text:  Unfortunately, the sons couldn\u2019t govern together peacefully and their war raged rivalry split the empire on the north-south line along the Balkan Peninsula. The territory was officially split in 395 when Theodosius I (ruled, 379-395) died leaving his son Arcadius emperor of the eastern half of the empire and his other son Honorius emperor of the western half. Throughout the fifth century, the western half of the Roman Empire lost most of its power through decline in political, economic and social situations, the last western emperor being deposed by Germanic mercenaries in AD 476; the eastern half, however, was flourishing.\n[5] Title: \"Roman emperor\" Text:  The two halves of empire, while often run as \"\"de facto\"\" separate entities day-to-day, were always considered and seen, legally and politically, as separate administrative divisions of a single, insoluble \"\"imperium\"\" by the Romans of the time. The final period of co-emperorship began in 395, when Emperor Theodosius I's sons Arcadius and Honorius succeeded as co-emperors. Eighty-five years later, following Germanic migrations which had reduced the empire's effective control across Brittania, Gaul and Hispania and a series of military coup d'\u00e9tat which drove Emperor Nepos out of Italy, the idea of dividing the position of emperor was formally abolished by Emperor Zeno (480).\nQuestion: the ruler of the holy roman empire that split his empire in half between his two sons was who\nYour answer: ",

Rice played in Super Bowls XXIII, XXIV, and XXIX. Romanowski played in Super Bowls XXIII, XXIV, XXXII, and XXXIII; the Raiders' loss prevented Romanowski from joining Charles Haley as the only NFL players at that time to earn 5 Super Bowl rings (Haley was also with the 49ers for Super Bowls XXIII and XXIV, and later earned rings when the Dallas Cowboys won Super Bowls XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX).\n[2] Title: \"Super Bowl XV\" Text:  Upshaw became the first player to play in three Super Bowls with the same team in three different decades. He also played in Super Bowls II (1967) and XI (1976). Oakland's defense, anchored by defensive end John Matuszak, was punishing. Defensive back Lester Hayes led the league in interceptions (13) and interception return yards (273), and was the league's Defensive Player of the Year. The Raiders also had a trio of great linebackers: future Hall of Famer Ted Hendricks, Pro Bowler Rod Martin (3 Interceptions), and standout rookie Matt Millen.\n[3] Title: \"Super Bowl XLIII\" Text:  Michael Irvin and Andre Reed were the first in Super Bowl XXVII, followed by Deion Branch and Muhsin Muhammad in Super Bowl XXXVIII and Branch again a year later along with Terrell Owens in Super Bowl XXXIX. Roethlisberger completed 21 of 30 passes for 256 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. Woodley had two sacks and a forced fumble, thus he continued setting NFL play-off records for consecutive multiple sack games by a player with 4. Arizona defensive tackle Darnell Dockett had all of Arizona's three sacks, tying the Super Bowl record set by Reggie White in Super Bowl XXXI.\n[4] Title: \"Super Bowl XXXIX\" Text:  Thomason saw time during several plays, although never had a ball thrown his way.

The western portion of Alta California then was organized and admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850. The California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes, with large-scale emigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom. The word \"\"California\"\" originally referred to the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico; it was later extended to the entire region composed of the current United States states of California, Nevada, and Utah, and parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming.\n[2] Title: \"People v. Hall\" Text:  Three Chinese witnesses had testified to the killing. With the conclusion of the Mexican\u2013American War, the area of Alta California (which contains the modern U.S. state of California and some other states to its east) came under the control of the United States. Formally, the area was ceded to the United States as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. In 1850, California formally joined the United States as the 31st state. Other parts of Alta California that became all or part of later U.S. states included Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming.\n[3] Title: \"California Gold Rush\" Text:  When the Gold Rush began, the California goldfields were peculiarly lawless places. When gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill, California was still technically part of Mexico, under American military occupation as the result of the Mexican\u2013American War. With the signing of the treaty ending the war on February 2, 1848, California became a possession of the United States, but it was not a formal \"\"territory\"\" and did not become a state until September 9, 1850. California existed in the unusual condition of a region under military control.\n[4] Title: California Text:  After a series of defensive battles in Southern California, the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed by the Californios on January 13, 1847, securing American control in California. Following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (February 2, 1848) that ended the war, the westernmost portion of the annexed Mexican territory of Alta California soon became the American state of California, and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new American Territories of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Utah. The lightly populated and arid lower region of old Baja California remained as a part of Mexico.\n[5] Title: \"History of San Diego\" Text:  By November 1846, American control was secured with the arrival of reinforcements from the USS \"\"Congress\"\". Following events near San Gabriel in early January 1847, peace returned to California. Alta California became part of the United States in 1848 following the U.S. victory in the Mexican\u2013American War and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The resident \"\"Californios\"\" became American citizens with full voting rights. California was admitted to the Union as a state in 1850.

The Federalists gained a great deal of prestige and advantage from the approval of George Washington, who had chaired the Constitutional Convention. Thomas Jefferson, serving as Minister to France at the time, had reservations about the proposed Constitution. He resolved to remain neutral in the debate and to accept either outcome. Promises of a Bill of Rights from Madison secured ratification in Virginia, while in New York, the Clintons, who controlled New York politics, found themselves outmaneuvered as Hamilton secured ratification by a 30\u201327 vote.\n[2] Title: \"James Madison\" Text:  Though no state conditioned ratification of the constitution on a bill of rights, several states came close, and the issue almost prevented the constitution from being ratified. Madison had opposed proposals for a bill of rights throughout the ratification process, but while running for Congress he had pledged to support a bill of rights. In the 1st Congress he took the lead in pressing for the passage of several constitutional amendments that would form the United States Bill of Rights. Madison feared that the states would call for a new constitutional convention if Congress failed to pass a bill of rights.\n[3] Title: \"United States Bill of Rights\" Text:  Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact. Madison remained active in the progress of the amendments throughout the legislative process. Historian Gordon S. Wood writes that \"\"there is no question that it was Madison's personal prestige and his dogged persistence that saw the amendments through the Congress. There might have been a federal Constitution without Madison but certainly no Bill of Rights.\"\" The twelve articles of amendment approved by congress were officially submitted to the Legislatures of the several States for consideration on September 28, 1789.\n[4] Title: \"James Madison\" Text:  For his role in drafting the first ten amendments to the Constitution during the 1st Congress, Madison is known as the \"\"Father of the Bill of Rights.\"\" Though he had played a major role in the enactment of a new constitution that created a stronger federal government, Madison opposed the centralization of power sought by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton during Washington's presidency. To oppose Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson and Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party, which became one of the nation's two first major political parties alongside Hamilton's Federalist Party.\n[5] Title: \"James Madison\" Text:  Proposed Article Two became part of the Constitution in 1992 as the Twenty-seventh Amendment, while proposed Article One is technically still pending before the states. Madison was disappointed that the Bill of Rights did not include protections against actions by state governments, but passage of the document mollified some critics of the original constitution and shored up Madison's support in Virginia. In proposing the Bill of Rights, Madison considered over two hundred amendments that had been proposed at the state ratifying conventions. While most of the amendments he proposed were drawn from these conventions, he was largely responsible for the portions of the Bill of Rights that guarantee freedom of the press, protection of property from government seizure, and jury trials.\nQuestion: who were the main proponents of amending the constitution to include a bill of rights\nYour answer: ",

Although some were driven by animal power, most early mills were built in rural areas at fast-flowing rivers and streams using water wheels for power. The development of viable steam engines by Boulton and Watt from 1781 led to the growth of larger, steam-powered mills allowing them to be concentrated in urban mill towns, like Manchester, which with neighbouring Salford had more than 50 mills by 1802.\n[2] Title: Cottonopolis Text:  Early cotton mills powered by water were built in Lancashire and its neighbouring counties. In 1781 Richard Arkwright opened the world's first steam-driven textile\n[3] Title: Cottonopolis Text:  Cottonopolis Cottonopolis was a 19th century nickname for Manchester, as it was a metropolis and the centre of the cotton industry. Early cotton mills powered by water were built in Lancashire and its neighbouring counties. In 1781 Richard Arkwright opened the world's first steam-driven textile mill on Miller Street in Manchester. Although initially inefficient, the arrival of steam power signified the beginning of the mechanisation that was to enhance the burgeoning textile industries in Manchester into the world's first centre of mass production. As textile manufacture switched from the home to factories, Manchester and towns in south and east Lancashire became the largest and most productive cotton spinning centre in the world using in 1871, 32% of global cotton production.\n[4] Title: \"History of New England\" Text:  The Beverly Cotton Manufactory was the first cotton mill in America, founded in Beverly, Massachusetts in 1787, and was considered the largest cotton mill of its time. Technological developments and achievements from the Manufactory led to the development of other, more advanced cotton mills, including Slater Mill in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Several textile mills were already underway during the time. Towns became famed as centers of the textile industry, such as Lawrence, Massachusetts, Lowell, Massachusetts, Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and Lewiston, Maine, following models from Slater Mill and the Beverly Cotton Manufactory.\n[5] Title: \"Textile manufacture during the British Industrial Revolution\" Text:  Matthew Boulton opened the Soho Foundry engineering works in Handsworth, Birmingham in 1762. These were both events that enabled cotton mill construction and the move away from home-based production. In 1764, Thorp Mill, the first water-powered cotton mill in the world was constructed at Royton, Lancashire, England. It was used for carding cotton. The multiple spindle spinning jenny was invented in 1764. James Hargreaves is credited as the inventor. This machine increased the thread production capacity of a single worker \u2014 initially eightfold and subsequently much further.

Nelson Mandela, then Deputy President of the African National Congress addressed a joint meeting in 1990.\n[2] Title: \"Joint session of the United States Congress\" Text:  Howard was acknowledged with a standing ovation and describes the occasion as a \"\"moving moment.\"\" The most recent addresses by foreign dignitaries were given by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 8, 2016, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on April 29, 2015, and Pope Francis on September 24, 2015. The Pope did not address the joint session as a religious dignitary but as a head of state. All foreign heads of state and heads of government are presented officially to Congress in the same manner as the President during the State of the Union Address and are introduced by the Speaker by their diplomatic style of address, followed by their name and respective office.\n[3] Title: \"Joint session of the United States Congress\" Text:  Written reports were standard until 1913, when Woodrow Wilson reestablished the practice of personally attending to deliver the speech. Since then, on a number of occasions presidents have presented a written report, usually for medical reasons. In addition to State of the Union addresses, inaugurals and counting of electoral votes, joint sessions or meetings usually fall into one of several topics. Joint meetings have been held more than a hundred times to enable foreign heads of state or heads of government to address Congress. Leaders of 48 countries have addressed Congress at a joint meeting: France leads the list with nine joint meeting addresses by heads of state or dignitaries.\n[4] Title: \"Joint session of the United States Congress\" Text:  Twice have joint meetings been attended by dignitaries from two countries: On September 18, 1978, when Congress was addressed by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and on July 26, 1994, when Congress was addressed by King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. John Howard, Prime Minister of Australia, had originally been scheduled to address Congress on September 12, 2001, but his address was postponed due to the September 11 terrorist attacks the previous day. Howard's address was rescheduled for June 12, 2002 where he spoke about the attacks he had witnessed 9 months earlier.\n[5] Title: \"Special Relationship\" Text:  In a speech to the United States Congress, nine days after the attacks, Bush declared \"\"America has no truer friend than Great Britain.\"\" Blair, one of the few world leaders to attend a presidential speech to Congress as a special guest of the First Lady, received two standing ovations from members of Congress. Blair's presence at the presidential speech remains the only time in U.S. political history that a foreign leader was in attendance at an emergency joint session of the U.S. Congress, a testimony to the strength of the U.S.\u2013U.K.\nQuestion: when was the last time a foreign leader addressed congress\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Heat transfer\" Text:  The principles of heat transfer in engineering systems can be applied to the human body in order to determine how the body transfers heat. Heat is produced in the body by the continuous metabolism of nutrients which provides energy for the systems of the body. The human body must maintain a consistent internal temperature in order to maintain healthy bodily functions. Therefore, excess heat must be dissipated from the body to keep it from overheating. When a person engages in elevated levels of physical activity, the body requires additional fuel which increases the metabolic rate and the rate of heat production.\n[2] Title: Warm-blooded Text:  Body heat is generated by metabolism. This refers to the chemical reactions cells use to break down glucose into water and carbon dioxide and, in so doing, generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a high-energy compound used to power other cellular processes. Muscle contraction is a type of metabolic process that generates heat energy, and heat is also generated through friction when blood flows through the circulatory system. All organisms metabolize food and other inputs, but some make better use of the output than others. Like all energy conversions, metabolism is rather inefficient, and around 60% of the available energy is converted to heat rather than to ATP.\n[3] Title: Endotherm Text:  The resting human body generates about two-thirds of its heat through metabolism in internal organs in the thorax and abdomen, as well as in the brain. The brain generates about 16% of the total heat produced by the body. Heat loss is a major threat to smaller creatures, as they have a larger ratio of surface area to volume. Small warm-blooded animals have insulation in the form of fur or feathers. Aquatic warm-blooded animals, such as seals, generally have deep layers of blubber under the skin and any pelage that they might have; both contribute to their insulation.\n[4] Title: Hypothermia Text:  Exhaustion and unconsciousness cause drowning, claiming the rest within a similar time. Heat is primarily generated in muscle tissue, including the heart, and in the liver, while it is lost through the skin (90%) and lungs (10%). Heat production may be increased two- to four-fold through muscle contractions (i.e. exercise and shivering). The rate of heat loss is determined, as with any object, by convection, conduction, and radiation. The rates of these can be affected by body mass index, body surface area to volume ratios, clothing and other environmental conditions.\n[5] Title: Thermogenesis Text:  It produces heat because the conversion of the chemical energy of ATP into kinetic energy causes almost all of the energy to show up as heat. Shivering is the process by which the body temperature of hibernating mammals (such as some bats and ground squirrels) is raised as these animals emerge from hibernation. Non-shivering thermogenesis occurs in brown adipose tissue (brown fat) that is present in almost all eutherians (swine being the only exception currently known). Brown adipose tissue has a unique uncoupling protein (thermogenin, also known as uncoupling protein 1) that allows the uncoupling of protons (H) moving down their mitochondrial gradient from the synthesis of ATP, thus allowing the energy to be dissipated as heat.\nQuestion: where does heat come from in our body\nYour answer: ",

The series is about music company owner Jerrica Benton, her singer alter-ego Jem, her band the Holograms, and their adventures. The series was a joint collaboration by Hasbro, Sunbow Productions and Marvel Productions, the same team responsible for \"\"\"\" and \"\"Transformers\"\".\n[2] Title: \"Jem (TV series)\" Text:  No official \"\"Jem\"\" soundtrack was ever released; however, many of the songs from the first season were released on cassette with dolls or play-sets. \"\"Jem\"\" was the #1 Nielsen rated syndicated cartoon series in November 1986 and in 1987 it was the third most watched children's program in syndication with 2.5 million viewers weekly. \"\"Jem\"\" has aired in multiple countries including Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, West Germany, Netherlands, United States, Italy and France. The show was nominated for the Young Artist Award twice, once in 1986 for \"\"Exceptional Young Actresses in Animation: Series, Specials, or Film Features\"\" for Samantha Newark's performance, then in 1988 for \"\"Best Animation Series\"\".\n[3] Title: \"Animation in the United States in the television era\" Text:  The 1980s also saw a number of cartoons based on children's toys, such as \"\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\"\", \"\"\"\", \"\"The Transformers\"\", \"\"My Little Pony 'n Friends\"\", \"\"He-Man\"\", \"\"\"\", \"\"Jem and the Holograms\"\" and \"\"Care Bears\"\". There were even cartoons based on \"\"Pac-Man\"\" video games and \"\"the Rubik's Cube\"\". Some of them even inspired feature films.\n[4] Title: \"Saturday-morning cartoon\" Text:  A Hanna-Barbera adaptation of the Belgian comic strip \"\"The Smurfs\"\" became a huge success in the 1980s, bringing with it other series with fairytale-like settings (\"\"My Little Pony\"\", \"\"Monchichis\"\", \"\"Trollkins\"\", \"\"Snorks\"\", etc.) Most of the genres made popular in previous generations (funny animals, superheroes, teen mysteries, science fiction and live-action adaptations) continued to appear as well, with the exception of the musical band cartoons (only one of note, the syndicated \"\"Jem and the Holograms\"\", emerged in the 1980s); by this time, the bands were engaged in making music videos of their own, and listeners looking for their favorite bands ended up migrating to MTV.\n[5] Title: \"Jem (TV series)\" Text:  The comic book offers a modern re-imagining of the series with new character designs and different situations, such as the Holograms and the Misfits being unsigned bands at the start with Eric Raymond being hired as the Misfits' manager during the second story arc. In addition, Kimber and Stormer begin a romantic relationship. As of Issue #16, which is Campbell's final issue as regular artist, The Stingers have been introduced to the series, with Raya being featured as a fourth member of the band. The title's current status within the new Hasbro Comic Book Universe (consisting of several new or relaunched titles, using the IDW \"\"Transformers\"\" comics as the backbone for a cohesive universe) has been somewhat erratic; IDW writers have generally indicated that, while characters from \"\"Jem\"\" will not show up in crossovers (including the \"\"Revolution\"\" mini-series that launched the universe), they do exist and will receive occasional references.\nQuestion: when did jem and the holograms come out\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"John White (colonist and artist)\" Text:  In 1587, White became governor of Sir Walter Raleigh's failed attempt at a permanent settlement on Roanoke Island, known to history as the \"\"Lost Colony\"\". This was the earliest effort to establish a permanent English colony in the New World. White's granddaughter Virginia Dare was the first English child born in the Americas. After the failure of the colony, White retired to Raleigh's estates in Ireland, reflecting upon the \"\"evils and unfortunate events\"\" which had ruined his hopes in America, though never giving up hope that his daughter and granddaughter were still alive.\n[2] Title: \"The Lost Colony (play)\" Text:  Shortly after arriving in this New World, colonist Eleanor Dare, daughter of Governor John White of the colony, gave birth to her daughter Virginia Dare. The governor's granddaughter was believed to be the first English child born in North America. Life on the island was difficult for the colonists. Low on supplies and facing retaliation from the Native Americans they had displaced, the colonists sent Governor White to England in the summer of 1587 for supplies. Because of the impending war with Spain, White was unable to return to Roanoke Island until 1590.\n[3] Title: \"Manteo, North Carolina\" Text:  Eventually, John White's daughter Eleanor married Ananias Dare, and they had the first American-born English child, Virginia Dare. In 1587, Manteo was friendly to White when he returned to find what the final stage of the Roanoke Colony became. When the colonists disappeared after supplies from England were delayed for three years, the ongoing mystery of \"\"The Lost Colony\"\" began. The \"\"Lost\"\" colony was established by Richard Grenville, who brought back two Indians, one of them Manteo. Manteo was named the seat of government for Dare County in 1870, and was incorporated in 1899.\n[4] Title: \"Ananias Dare\" Text:  John White left the group on August 27, 1587, and returned three years later, only to find the colony deserted. John Smith and other members of the Jamestown Colony sought information about the fate of the colonists in 1607. One report indicated that the Lost Colonists took refuge with friendly Chesapeake Indians, but Chief Powhatan claimed his tribe had attacked the group and killed most of the colonists. Powhatan showed Smith certain artifacts he said had belonged to the colonists, including a musket barrel and a brass mortar. The Jamestown Colony received reports of some survivors of the Lost Colony and sent out search parties, but none were successful.\n[5] Title: \"Roanoke Colony\" Text:  But just as the Anglo-Spanish War prevented White from returning in a timely manner, Spanish authorities in the New World could not muster enough support back home for such a venture. Once the Jamestown settlement was established in 1607, efforts were undertaken by the English to acquire information from the Powhatan tribe about Roanoke. The first definitive information concerning the fate of the Lost Colony came from Captain John Smith, leader of the Jamestown Colony from 1608 to 1609. According to chronicler Samuel Purchas, Smith learned from Chief Powhatan that he had personally conducted the slaughter of the Roanoke colonists just prior to the arrival of the Jamestown settlers because they were living with the Chesepians, a tribe living in the eastern portion of the present-day South Hampton Roads sub-region who were related to the Pamlico tribe in Carolina and who refused to merge with the Powhatans.\nQuestion: who was in charge of the lost colony\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: FSCAN Text:  FSCAN FScan is a disk scheduling algorithm to determine the motion of the disk's arm and head in servicing read and write requests. It uses two subqueues. During the scan, all of the requests are in the first queue and all new requests are put into the second queue. Thus, service of new requests is deferred until all of the old requests have been processed. When the scan ends, the arm is taken to the first queue entries and is started all over again. FSCAN along with N-Step-SCAN prevents \"\"arm stickiness\"\" unlike SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN.\n[2] Title: \"Elevator algorithm\" Text:  At this point both have reached the highest (end) track request. SCAN will just reverse direction and service the next closest disk request (in this example, 20) and C-SCAN will always go back to track 0 and start going to higher track requests. \"\"Note:\"\" Even though six seeks were performed using the C-SCAN algorithm, only five I/Os were actually done. \"\"Definition of C-SCAN:\"\" C-SCAN moves the head from one end of the Disk to the other end, servicing requests along the way.\n[3] Title: \"Elevator algorithm\" Text:  One variation of this method ensures all requests are serviced in only one direction, that is, once the head has arrived at the outer edge of the disk, it returns to the beginning and services the new requests in this one direction only (or vice versa). This is known as the \"\"Circular Elevator Algorithm\"\" or C-SCAN. Although the time of the return seek is wasted, this results in more equal performance for all head positions, as the expected distance from the head is always half the maximum distance, unlike in the standard elevator algorithm where cylinders in the middle will be serviced as much as twice as often as the innermost or outermost cylinders.\n[4] Title: \"Elevator algorithm\" Text:  Other variations include: The following is an example of how to calculate average disk seek times for both the SCAN and C-SCAN algorithms. Both SCAN and C-SCAN behave in the same manner until they reach the last track queued. For the sake of this example let us assume that the SCAN algorithm is currently going from a lower track number to a higher track number (like the C-SCAN is doing). For both methods, one takes the difference in magnitude (i.e. absolute value) between the next track request and the current track.\n[5] Title: \"I/O scheduling\" Text:  I/O scheduling Input/output (I/O) scheduling is the method that computer operating systems use to decide in which order the block I/O operations will be submitted to storage volumes. I/O scheduling is sometimes called disk scheduling. I/O scheduling usually has to work with hard disk drives that have long access times for requests placed far away from the current position of the disk head (this operation is called a seek). To minimize the effect this has on system performance, most I/O schedulers implement a variant of the elevator algorithm that reorders the incoming randomly ordered requests so the associated data would be accessed with minimal arm/head movement.\nQuestion: 4 . what does c stand for in case of disk scheduling algorithms\nYour answer: ",

Bull\" Text:  An ex post facto law or retroactive law, is a law that retroactively changes the legal consequences of acts committed or the legal status of facts and relationships that existed prior to the enactment of the law. The holding in this case still remains good law: the ex post facto provision of the Constitution applies solely to criminal cases, not civil cases. In this case, the participating Supreme Court judges were: William Cushing, James Iredell, William Paterson and Samuel Chase. Justice Samuel Chase argued that the government has no authority to interfere with an individual's rights, and \"\"the general principles of law and reason\"\" forbid the legislature from interfering.\n[2] Title: \"Ex post facto law\" Text:  Ex post facto law An \"\"ex post facto\"\" law (corrupted from ) is a law that retroactively changes the legal consequences (or status) of actions that were committed, or relationships that existed, before the enactment of the law. In criminal law, it may criminalize actions that were legal when committed; it may aggravate a crime by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed; it may change the punishment prescribed for a crime, as by adding new penalties or extending sentences; or it may alter the rules of evidence in order to make conviction for a crime likelier than it would have been when the deed was committed.\n[3] Title: Retrospective Text:  Because such laws punish the accused for acts that were not unlawful when committed, they are rare, and not permissible in most legal systems. More commonly, changes retroactively worsen the legal consequences (or status) of actions that were committed, or relationships that existed, by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed; by changing the punishment or recompense prescribed, as by adding new penalties, extending sentences, or increasing fines and damages payable; or it may alter the rules of evidence in order to make exoneration more difficult than it would have been.\n[4] Title: Retrospective Text:  Conversely, a form of retrospective law commonly called an amnesty law may decriminalize certain acts. A pardon has a similar effect, in a specific case instead of a class of cases. An \"\"in mitius\"\" change may alleviate possible consequences for unlawful acts (for example by replacing the death sentence with lifelong imprisonment) retroactively. Finally, when a previous law is repealed or otherwise nullified, it is no longer applicable to situations to which it had been, even if such situations arose before the law was voided; this principle is known as \"\"nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali\"\".\n[5] Title: \"Hate crime laws in the United States\" Text:  One of the changes in the bill was the sentence increase for \"\"defacing or destroying any religious real property because of race, color, or ethnic characteristics\u2026\"\" from 10 to 20 years. It also changed the statute of limitations from five years to seven years after the date the crime was committed. It reauthorizes the Hate Crimes Statistics Act. On October 28, 2009 President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, attached to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which expanded existing United States federal hate crime law to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.\nQuestion: the law or bill that changes the legal consequences of acts committed on the legal status of facts\nYour answer: ",

It was directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and is based on a 1945 novel written by Josephine Leslie under the pseudonym of R. A. Dick. In 1945, 20th Century Fox bought the film rights to the novel, which had been published only in the United Kingdom at that time. It was shot entirely in California. In the early 1900s, young widow Lucy Muir moves to the seaside English village of Whitecliff despite the disapproval of her mother-in-law and domineering sister-in-law.\n[2] Title: \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" Text:  In the writer's opinion, Harrison \"\"has such an ingratiating personality that this compensates in large measure for the lack of characterization in his role\"\", but Tierney \"\"is a pretty girl, but has no depth of feeling as an actress.\"\" Charles Lang received a 1947 Academy Award nomination for his cinematography on the movie. The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: \"\"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\"\" was adapted as an hour-long radio play on the December 1, 1947 broadcast of \"\"Lux Radio Theater\"\" with Charles Boyer and Madeleine Carroll, and was also adapted on the August 16, 1951 \"\"Screen Director's Playhouse\"\" with Boyer and Jane Wyatt.\n[3] Title: \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" Text:  She rents Gull Cottage despite its reputation of being haunted by the spirit of a seaman who committed suicide there, and moves in with her young daughter, Anna, and her maid, Martha. On the first night she is visited by the apparition of the former owner, a roguish but harmless sea captain named Daniel Gregg. He tells her that his death four years ago was not a suicide but was the product of accidentally kicking open the valve on a gas-fired room heater while asleep. He explains that he had wanted to turn Gull Cottage into a home for retired seamen and does not appreciate her being there, nor previous renters he has chased away.\n[4] Title: \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" Text:  He didn't leave a will - including his plans for the house - because he hadn't anticipated dying so soon. Due to Lucy's appreciation of the house, Daniel reluctantly agrees to allow her to live in Gull Cottage and promises to make himself known only to her. It is not long before Muir's mother-in-law and her sister arrive with the news that Lucy's investment income has dried up, and they insist that Lucy move back to London with them. After his ghostly eviction of the two women, Captain Gregg comes up with an idea to save the house: he will dictate his memoirs to Lucy, she will have them published and keep the royalties.\n[5] Title: \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" Text:  Fairley follows her back to Whitecliff and begins a whirlwind courtship. Captain Gregg, initially disgusted by their relationship, decides to cease being an obstacle to her happiness. While Lucy sleeps, Captain Gregg places the suggestion in her mind that she alone wrote the book and that he was just a dream. He suggests to her, \"\"You must make your own life amongst the living and, whether you meet fair winds or foul, find your own way to harbour in the end.\"\" Afterwards, Gregg fades away.\nQuestion: who played in the ghost and mrs. muir\nYour answer: ",

On April 13, 2010, parent company Republic announced that Midwest Airlines and Frontier Airlines would merge, with the Midwest brand disappearing in late 2011. Midwest Airlines' final flight operated with a Boeing 717-200 and staffed with Midwest Airlines flight crews landed in Milwaukee on November 2, 2009. Effective November 3, 2009, Midwest Airlines ceased to exist as an actual operating airline (allowing its DOT air carrier operator certificate to lapse).\n[2] Title: \"Midwest Airlines\" Text:  Users were then redirected to Frontier Airlines' website. Midwest's YX code was retired in early November 2010 and adopted by Republic Airlines. In August 2017, reports surfaced that there are ongoing efforts to revive the Midwest brand. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, a group of people are trying to secure investors to relaunch the airline using the original \"\"Midwest Express\"\" brand. This is a list of destinations that Midwest Airlines, operated by Frontier Airlines and Republic Airlines served as of April 2010. Midwest Connect destinations are not included.\n[3] Title: \"Midwest Airlines\" Text:  All service was flown nonstop between Milwaukee and these destinations, with the exception of a nonstop route between Appleton and Newark in 1984 that had been discontinued by 1985. The airline was serving the following destinations in June 2001: In early 2002 Kansas City became a secondary hub for the airline while Omaha became a focus city. In 2002, the airline made another major change, shortening its name from Midwest Express to simply Midwest. A major reason for the change was the modern association of \"\"express\"\" with a regional airline, which Midwest was not.\n[4] Title: \"Midwest Airlines\" Text:  After fourteen years of profit-making, Midwest Express was affected with serious financial problems after the September 11 terrorist attacks. To return to profitability, the airline made major changes. The Omaha hub was reduced to a focus city in early 2002, with hub status transferred to Kansas City. Some MD-80 series aircraft were reconfigured into a new \"\"Saver Service\"\", featuring cloth coach seats in a 2-by-3 arrangement. Saver Service, while decreasing the width of the seats, continued to feature ample legroom. This service was initially offered from the Milwaukee and Kansas City hubs to leisure destinations such as Florida, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Phoenix on McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft.\n[5] Title: \"Midwest Airlines\" Text:  This made the airline popular with business travelers. In addition, Midwest Express operated a sizable executive charter operation with a specially configured DC-9. In 1989, Midwest Express added two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft to its fleet, eventually acquiring eleven additional aircraft between 1998 and 2001. These enabled the airline to expand services to the West Coast and Florida. The airline experienced steady growth and continued profitability, opening an additional hub in Omaha, Nebraska in early 1995. Midwest Express also started its own regional subsidiary, Skyway Airlines, The Midwest Express Connection, to provide commuter airline service to small communities in Wisconsin and the surrounding region.\nQuestion: when did midwest express go out of business\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: CYP3A4 Text:  The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases that catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids components. The CYP3A4 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, and its expression is induced by glucocorticoids and some pharmacological agents. Cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize approximately 60% of prescribed drugs, with CYP3A4 responsible for about half of this metabolism;, substrates include acetaminophen, codeine, ciclosporin (cyclosporin), diazepam, and erythromycin. The enzyme also metabolizes some steroids and carcinogens. Most drugs undergo deactivation by CYP3A4, either directly or by facilitated excretion from the body.\n[2] Title: \"Cytochrome P450\" Text:  A classical example includes anti-epileptic drugs. Phenytoin, for example, induces CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. Substrates for the latter may be drugs with critical dosage, like amiodarone or carbamazepine, whose blood plasma concentration may either increase because of enzyme inhibition in the former, or decrease because of enzyme induction in the latter. Naturally occurring compounds may also induce or inhibit CYP activity. For example, bioactive compounds found in grapefruit juice and some other fruit juices, including bergamottin, dihydroxybergamottin, and paradicin-A, have been found to inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of certain medications, leading to increased bioavailability and, thus, the strong possibility of overdosing.\n[3] Title: Antifungal Text:  There are also many drug interactions. Patients must read in detail the enclosed data sheet(s) of any medicine. For example, the azole antifungals such as ketoconazole or itraconazole can be both substrates and inhibitors of the P-glycoprotein, which (among other functions) excretes toxins and drugs into the intestines. Azole antifungals also are both substrates and inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 family CYP3A4, causing increased concentration when administering, for example, calcium channel blockers, immunosuppressants, chemotherapeutic drugs, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, macrolides and SSRIs.\n[4] Title: Chloramphenicol Text:  Chloramphenicol is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in the liver. Inhibition of CYP2C19 causes decreased metabolism and therefore increased levels of, for example, antidepressants, antiepileptics, proton-pump inhibitors, and anticoagulants if they are given concomitantly. Inhibition of CYP3A4 causes increased levels of, for example, calcium channel blockers, immunosuppressants, chemotherapeutic drugs, benzodiazepines, azole antifungals, tricyclic antidepressants, macrolide antibiotics, SSRIs, statins, cardiac antiarrhythmics, antivirals, anticoagulants, and PDE5 inhibitors. Chloramphenicol is antagonistic with most cephalosporins and using both together should be avoided in the treatment of infections.\n[5] Title: Nevirapine Text:  Nevirapine is a substrate for liver CYP3A and CYP2B6 enzymes. Concomitant administration of drugs that are inhibitors of these enzymes may increase serum nevirapine levels significantly. Some examples of these drugs include ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fluconazole. On the other hand, drugs that are inducers of these enzymes such as rifampicin may lower serum nevirapine levels. In addition, concomitant use of St. John's wort \"\"(Hypericum perforatum)\"\" or St. John's wort containing products may significantly lower nevirapine levels. Nevirapine is an inducer of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2B6.\nQuestion: drugs that are substrates of cytochrome p450 3a4 and cyp2d6\nYour answer: ",

In 1498 A.D Vasco da Gama arrived at the harbour of Calicut (Kozhikode) on the western coast of India. It was after this that the Portuguese established their power on the western coast of India. During that time John III of Portugal had ascended the throne of Portugal. He appointed Nuno da Cunha as the Governor of Goa in order to conquer the island of Diu from the sultan of Gujarat. Under his leadership, the Portuguese started endeavours to conquer the island of Diu.\n[2] Title: \"Colonial India\" Text:  Though Portugal presence in India initially started in 1498, its colonial rule ranges from 1505 to 1961. The Portuguese Empire established the first European trading centre at Kollam, Kerala. In 1505 King Manuel I of Portugal appointed Dom Francisco de Almeida as the first Portuguese viceroy in India, followed in 1509 by Dom Afonso de Albuquerque. In 1510 Albuquerque conquered the city of Goa, which had been controlled by Muslims. He inaugurated the policy of marrying Portuguese soldiers and sailors with local Indian girls, the consequence of which was a great miscegenation in Goa and other Portuguese territories in Asia.\n[3] Title: \"Portuguese Empire\" Text:  In 1505 King Manuel I of Portugal appointed Francisco de Almeida first Viceroy of Portuguese India, establishing the Portuguese government in the east. That year the Portuguese also conquered Kannur, where they founded St. Angelo Fort, and Louren\u00e7o de Almeida arrived in Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka), where he discovered the source of cinnamon. Although Cankili I of Jaffna initially resisted contact with them, the Jaffna kingdom came to the attention of Portuguese officials soon after for their resistance to missionary activities as well as logistical reasons due to its proximity with Trincomalee harbour among other reasons.\n[4] Title: \"Portuguese India\" Text:  Francisco de Almeida left Portugal with a fleet of 22 vessels with 1,500 men. On 13 September, Francisco de Almeida reached Anjadip Island, where he immediately started the construction of Fort Anjediva. On 23 October, with the permission of the friendly ruler of Cannanore, he started building St. Angelo Fort at Cannanore, leaving Louren\u00e7o de Brito in charge with 150 men and two ships.

The latter was abolished in 1991 and the blue center star was changed to white to conform to all enlisted rank chevrons.\n[3] Title: \"Senior airman\" Text:  The Air Force promotes an Airman First Class (A1C) to Senior Airman after 36 months time in service (TIS) and 20 months time in grade (TIG), or 28 months TIG, whichever occurs first. Outstanding Airmen First Class, limited to no more than 15 percent of the total, may be promoted to Senior Airmen six months early, in a competitive process called Below-the-Zone, which normally involves going before a competitive board. Senior Airmen are expected to be technically proficient and begin to develop leadership skills, and may be expected to supervise an Airman of lesser rank.\n[4] Title: \"Senior airman\" Text:  Senior Airmen must attend the six-week Airman Leadership School, the first course of the Air Force's college of enlisted professional military education, before being promoted to staff sergeant. SrA with no projected promotion and between three and six years TIS, may attend Airman Leadership School. Formerly, from 1976 to 1991, this grade was divided into ranks with separate titles: sergeant (referred to unofficially but almost universally within the USAF as \"\"Buck Sergeant\"\" or simply \"\"Buck\"\"), a non-commissioned officer; and Senior Airman, which is the equivalent of Specialist, a non-supervisory rank.\n[5] Title: Sergeant Text:  The current title for airmen at the E4 grade is \"\"Senior Airman\"\". From 1976 - 1995, senior airman rank insignia had a subdued central star (light blue vice silver for sergeant and above), as did airman first class (E3) and airman (E2). Airman Basic, E1, has no rank insignia. In today's Air Force, the term sergeant refers to all Air Force non-commissioned officers up to master sergeant (E-7).

This was the seventh time that Miami hosted the game. The Chargers were the biggest surprise of the 1994 season, with very few expecting them to even reach the playoffs, let alone the Super Bowl. San Diego suffered losing seasons in the 1980s until former Washington Redskins general manager Bobby Beathard joined the team in 1990. Beathard decided to rebuild the Chargers using the same model that he used to build the Redskins into Super Bowl contenders during the 1980s \u2013 a powerful running game built around big linemen, a passing game that helped sustain extremely long drives, and a bending but steady defense.\n[2] Title: \"Super Bowl XXIX\" Text:  Super Bowl XXIX Super Bowl XXIX was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion San Diego Chargers and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1994 season. This is the only Super Bowl in history to be played between two teams from the same state. The 49ers defeated the Chargers by the score of 49\u201326, becoming the first team to win five Super Bowl championships. The game was played on January 29, 1995 at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami, Florida (now part of the suburb of Miami Gardens, which became a separate city in 2003).\n[3] Title: \"Los Angeles Chargers\" Text:  Ross was named NFL Coach of the Year for the Chargers' dramatic turnaround by Pro Football Weekly. In the first round of the playoffs, the Chargers shut out the Chiefs 17\u20130, but the Dolphins shut out the Chargers in the divisional playoffs to eliminate the Chargers. In 1993, the Chargers finished 8\u20138 (fourth in their division). In the 1994 season, the Chargers made their first and, so far, only Super Bowl appearance, against the 49ers in Super Bowl XXIX. They got to the Super Bowl by winning their first six regular season games, the only NFL team to do so in 1994, and finished the season 11\u20135.\n[4] Title: \"Stan Humphries\" Text:  In what would become one of pro football's all-time great upsets, the Chargers again rallied from a 13-3 deficit late in the 3rd quarter and held off a furious last-minute Pittsburgh drive with a goal-line stand to win the AFC championship 17-13 at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium. Thus the Chargers earned a trip to Miami and Super Bowl XXIX, the first and only Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. Humphries executed the first successful two-point conversion in the Super Bowl (which was adopted by the NFL at the start of the 1994 season), throwing a pass to Mark Seay.\n[5] Title: \"Super Bowl XXIX\" Text:  The Chargers, on the other hand, were regarded as a \"\"Cinderella\"\" team, and advanced to their first Super Bowl after posting an 11\u20135 regular-season record and overcoming halftime deficits in both of their playoff wins. This was the first Super Bowl in which both teams scored in all four quarters. The combined aggregate score of 75 points and the ten total touchdowns both remain Super Bowl records. Still, the 49ers controlled most of the game, with Young completing touchdown passes in each of the 49ers' first two drives.\nQuestion: when did the chargers make the super bowl\nYour answer: ",

Adam and Eve also now have a more distant relationship with God, who is omnipresent but invisible (unlike the tangible Father in the Garden of Eden). Satan, formerly called Lucifer, is the first major character introduced in the poem. He was once the most beautiful of all angels, and is a tragic figure who famously declares: \"\"Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.\"\"\n[2] Title: Hubris Text:  Hubris is also referred to as \"\"pride that blinds\"\" because it often causes a committer of hubris to act in foolish ways that belie common sense. In other words, the modern definition may be thought of as, \"\"that pride that goes just before the fall.\"\" Examples of hubris are often found in literature, most famously in John Milton's \"\"Paradise Lost\"\", in which Lucifer attempts to compel the other angels to worship him, is cast into hell by God and the innocent angels, and proclaims: \"\"Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.\"\"\n[3] Title: \"The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)\" Text:  Encouraged by Mary Ann, Kevin agrees; after they leave, Larry transforms into Milton, relishing the sin of vanity. The Devil character's name is a direct homage to John Milton, who wrote \"\"Paradise Lost\"\", quoted by Lomax with the line \"\"\"\"Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heav'n\"\"\"\". Despite this, the thrust of Milton's epic was to rebuke the devil. As a rebel against God, complaining of being perpetually \"\"underestimated\"\", the Milton character, like \"\"Paradise Lost\"\"s Satan, is \"\"\"\"Heav'n running from Heav'n\"\"\"\" with a \"\"\"\"sense of injur'd merit\"\"\"\".\n[4] Title: \"The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)\" Text:  In an early version of the screenplay, the \"\"Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven\"\" quotation is given to Milton rather than Lomax. Al Pacino had previously been offered the Devil role in attempts at adapting Neiderman's novel, but before final rewrites, rejected it on three occasions, for the clich\u00e9 nature of the character. Keanu Reeves chose to star in \"\"Devil's Advocate\"\" over \"\"\"\", despite a promised $11 million for the sequel to his 1994 hit \"\"Speed\"\"; according to Reeves' staff, the actor was averse to performing in two consecutive action films after \"\"Chain Reaction\"\" (1996).\n[5] Title: \"Christ Illusion\" Text:  However, vandals attacked St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York, by spray-painting a large pentagram in front of the doors, black inverted crosses in two columns in front of the main entrance, and the number six on three steps leading into the Seminary.

G. Wells' novel \"\"The War of the Worlds\"\" (1898). It was performed and broadcast live as a Halloween episode at 8 p.m. on Sunday, October 30, 1938 over the Columbia Broadcasting System radio network. The episode became famous for causing panic among its listening audience, but the scale of that panic is disputed, as the program had relatively few listeners.\n[2] Title: \"The War of the Worlds (radio drama)\" Text:  The one-hour program began with the theme music for the \"\"Mercury Theatre on the Air\"\" and an announcement that the evening's show was an adaption of \"\"The War of the Worlds\"\". This was followed by a prologue read by Orson Welles which was closely based on the opening of H.G. Wells' novel. The next half hour of the broadcast was presented as typical evening of radio programming which was interrupted by a series of news bulletins. The first few bulletins interrupt a program of dance music and describe a series of odd explosions observed on Mars.\n[3] Title: \"The War of the Worlds (radio drama)\" Text:  Finally, a ham radio operator is heard calling, \"\"2X2L calling CQ, New York.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Motor neuron\" Text:  Upon adequate stimulation, the motor neuron releases a flood of acetylcholine (Ach) neurotransmitters from the axon terminals from synaptic vesicles bind with the plasma membrane. The acetylcholine molecules bind to postsynaptic receptors found within the motor end plate. Once two acetylcholine receptors have been bound, an ion channel is opened and sodium ions are allowed to flow into the cell. The influx of sodium into the cell causes depolarization and triggers a muscle action potential. T tubules of the sarcolemma are then stimulated to elicit calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\n[2] Title: \"Stimulus (physiology)\" Text:  When muscles receive information from internal or external stimuli, muscle fibers are stimulated by their respective motor neuron. Impulses are passed from the central nervous system down neurons until they reach the motor neuron, which releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into the neuromuscular junction. ACh binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the surface of the muscle cell and opens ion channels, allowing sodium ions to flow into the cell and potassium ions to flow out; this ion movement causes a depolarization, which allows for the release of calcium ions within the cell.\n[3] Title: \"Neuromuscular junction\" Text:  Calcium ions bind to sensor proteins (synaptotagmin) on synaptic vesicles, triggering vesicle fusion with the cell membrane and subsequent neurotransmitter release from the motor neuron into the synaptic cleft. In vertebrates, motor neurons release acetylcholine (ACh), a small molecule neurotransmitter, which diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the cell membrane of the muscle fiber, also known as the sarcolemma. nAChRs are ionotropic receptors, meaning they serve as ligand-gated ion channels. The binding of ACh to the receptor can depolarize the muscle fiber, causing a cascade that eventually results in muscle contraction.\n[4] Title: Pyridostigmine Text:  In a synapse, action potentials are conducted along motor nerves to their terminals where they initiate a Ca influx and the release of acetylcholine (ACh). The ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors on the post synaptic membrane, causing an influx of Na, resulting in depolarization. If large enough, this depolarization results in an action potential. To prevent constant stimulation once the ACh is released, an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase is present in the endplate membrane close to the receptors on the post synaptic membrane, and quickly hydrolyses ACh.\n[5] Title: \"Neuromuscular junction\" Text:  The acetylcholine that reaches the endplate activates ~2,000 acetylcholine receptors, opening their ion channels which permits sodium ions to move into the endplate producing a depolarization of ~0.5 mV known as a miniature endplate potential (MEPP). By the time the acetylcholine is released from the receptors the acetylcholinesterase has destroyed its bound ACh, which takes about ~0.16 ms, and hence is available to destroy the ACh released from the receptors. When the motor nerve is stimulated there is a delay of only 0.5 to 0.8 msec between the arrival of the nerve impulse in the motor nerve terminals and the first response of the endplate The arrival of the motor nerve action potential at the presynaptic neuron terminal opens voltage-dependent calcium channels and Ca ions flow from the extracellular fluid into the presynaptic neuron's cytosol.\nQuestion: as a result of ach stimulation calcium ions are released from the\nYour answer: ",

In other sources, he is said to have introduced the first principal actor in addition to the chorus. Thespis was a singer of dithyrambs (songs about stories from mythology with choric refrains). He is credited with introducing a new style in which one singer or actor performed the words of individual characters in the stories, distinguishing between the characters with the aid of different masks.\n[2] Title: Thespis Text:  It is implied that Thespis invented acting in the Western world, and that prior to his performances, no one had ever assumed the resemblance of another person for the purpose of storytelling. In fact, Thespis is the first known actor in \"\"written\"\" plays. He may thus have had a substantial role in changing the way stories were told and inventing theatre as we know it today. In reverence to Thespis, actors in the English-speaking part of the world have been referred to as \"\"thespians\"\".\n[3] Title: Thespis Text:  A first season episode of the TV series \"\"\"\" was named \"\"Thespis\"\" and referenced him.

In other sources, he is said to have introduced the first principal actor in addition to the chorus.\n[4] Title: \"Greek tragedy\" Text:  Naturally, the transformation of the leader into an actor entailed a dramatization of the chorus. Tradition attributes Thespis as the first person to represent a character in a play. This took place in 534 BC during the Dionysia established by Peisistratus. Of his tragedies we know little except that the choir was still formed by Satyrs and that, according to Aristotle, he was the first to win a dramatic contest, and the first () who portrayed a character rather than speaking as himself. Moreover, Themistius, a writer of the 4th century AD, reports that Thespis invented the prologue as well as the spoken part ().\n[5] Title: \"Ancient Greek literature\" Text:  Choral performances were a common tradition in all Greek city-states. The Athenians credited a man named Thespis with having invented drama by introducing the first actor, whose primary purpose was to interact with the leader of the chorus. Later playwrights expanded the number of actors to three, allowing for greater freedom in storytelling. In the age that followed the Greco-Persian Wars, the awakened national spirit of Athens was expressed in hundreds of tragedies based on heroic and legendary themes of the past. The tragic plays grew out of simple choral songs and dialogues performed at festivals of the god Dionysus.\nQuestion: thespian ' is used to describe this ancient greek artist who is considered to be the first actor\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Sex and gender distinction\" Text:  By the 20th century, this meaning was obsolete, and the only formal use of \"\"gender\"\" was in grammar. This changed in the early 1970s when the work of John Money, particularly the popular college textbook \"\"Man & Woman, Boy & Girl\"\", was embraced by feminist theory. This meaning of \"\"gender\"\" is now prevalent in the social sciences, although in many other contexts, \"\"gender\"\" includes \"\"sex\"\" or replaces it. Gender was first only used in languages to describe the feminine and masculine words, up until around the 1960s.\n[2] Title: Gender Text:  Today, the distinction is followed in some contexts, especially the social sciences and documents written by the World Health Organization (WHO). In other contexts, including some areas of the social sciences, \"\"gender\"\" includes \"\"sex\"\" or replaces it. For instance, in non-human animal research, \"\"gender\"\" is commonly used to refer to the biological sex of the animals. This change in the meaning of gender can be traced to the 1980s. In 1993, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) started to use \"\"gender\"\" instead of \"\"sex\"\".\n[3] Title: \"Gender role\" Text:  Various groups, most notably the feminist movement, have led efforts to change aspects of prevailing gender roles that they believe are oppressive or inaccurate. The term \"\"gender role\"\" was first used by John Money and colleagues in 1954, during the course of his study of intersex individuals, to describe the manners in which these individuals expressed their status as a male or female in a situation where no clear biological assignment existed. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines gender roles as \"\"socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women\"\".\n[4] Title: Gender Text:  Some cultures have specific gender roles that are distinct from \"\"man\"\" and \"\"woman,\"\" such as the hijras of South Asia. These are often referred to as \"\"third genders\"\". Sexologist John Money introduced the terminological distinction between biological sex and gender as a role in 1955. Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word \"\"gender\"\" to refer to anything but grammatical categories. However, Money's meaning of the word did not become widespread until the 1970s, when feminist theory embraced the concept of a distinction between biological sex and the social construct of gender.\n[5] Title: Gender Text:  Both these definitions are facing opposite directions with their own defined set of rules and criteria on which the said systems are based. Sexologist John Money coined the term \"\"gender role\"\" in 1955. The term \"\"gender role\"\" is defined as the actions or responses that may reveal their status as boy, man, girl or woman, respectively. Elements surrounding gender roles include clothing, speech patterns, movement, occupations, and other factors not limited to biological sex. In contrast to taxonomic approaches, some feminist philosophers have argued that gender \"\"is a vast orchestration of subtle mediations between oneself and others\"\", rather than a \"\"private cause behind manifest behaviours\"\".\nQuestion: when did they change the definition of gender\nYour answer: ",

Bill T. Arnold and H. G. M. Williamson wrote that if There is also doubt among some scholars about any historicity of the Book of Judges. In the Hebrew Bible, Moses is described as a \"\"shofet\"\" over the Israelites and appoints others to whom cases were delegated in accordance with the advice of Jethro, his Midianite father-in-law. The Book of Judges mentions twelve leaders who judged Israel: Othniel, Ehud, Shamgar, Deborah, Gideon, Tola, Jair, Jephthah, Ibzan, Elon, Abdon, and Samson.\n[2] Title: \"Biblical judges\" Text:  Biblical judges The biblical judges are described in the Hebrew Bible, and mostly in the Book of Judges, as people who served roles as military leaders in times of crisis, in the period before an Israelite monarchy was established. A cyclical pattern is regularly recounted in the Book of Judges to show the need for the various judges: apostasy of the Israelite people, hardship brought on as punishment from God, crying out to the Lord for rescue. The story of the judges seems to describe successive individuals, each from a different tribe of Israel, described as chosen by God to rescue the people from their enemies and establish justice.\n[3] Title: \"Book of Judges\" Text:  The cyclical pattern set out in the prologue is readily apparent at the beginning, but as the stories progress it begins to disintegrate, mirroring the disintegration of the world of the Israelites. Although some scholars consider the stories not to be presented in chronological order, the judges in the order in which they appear in the text are: There are also brief glosses on six minor judges: Shamgar (3:31), Tola and Jair (10:1\u20135), Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (12:8\u201315). Some scholars have inferred that the minor judges were actual adjudicators, whereas the major judges were leaders and did not actually make legal judgements.\n[4] Title: \"Book of Judges\" Text:  The Israelites meet, most likely at the sanctuary at Gilgal or at Shechem (following on from ) and ask the Lord who should be first (in order of time, not of rank) to secure the land they are to occupy. The main text () gives accounts of six major judges and their struggles against the oppressive kings of surrounding nations, as well as the story of Abimelech, an Israelite leader (a judge [shofet] in the sense of \"\"chieftain\"\") who oppresses his own people.\n[5] Title: \"Book of Judges\" Text:  Book of Judges The Book of Judges (, \"\"\"\") is the seventh book of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. In the narrative of the Hebrew Bible, it covers the time between the conquest described in the Book of Joshua and the establishment of a kingdom in the Books of Samuel, during which Biblical judges served as temporary leaders. The stories follow a consistent pattern: the people are unfaithful to Yahweh and he therefore delivers them into the hands of their enemies; the people repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which he sends in the form of a leader or champion (a \"\"judge\"\"; see \"\"shophet\"\"); the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression and they prosper, but soon they fall again into unfaithfulness and the cycle is repeated.\nQuestion: how many judges are there in the book of judges in the bible\nYour answer: ",

O'Neal and Dougy Williams. The Buckwheat Boyz were signed by Koch Records, and recorded their first and only full-length record. From this self-titled album, the song \"\"Peanut Butter Jelly Time\"\" became popular on the Internet after a flash music video featuring an animated dancing banana was created. The popularity of the song increased as it was featured on TV shows such as \"\"The Proud Family\"\", \"\"Family Guy\"\", and \"\"Regular Show\"\".\n[2] Title: \"The Courtship of Stewie's Father\" Text:  MacFarlane made the sound effects of Stewie and Peter laughing excessively after attacking Lois, with no sounds of laughter being used from previous episodes. MacFarlane comments that he was \"\"sweaty and exhausted after it\"\". The reaction to the \"\"Peanut Butter Jelly Time\"\" scene astonished MacFarlane, as he believes it has become repetitious and annoying after he visited a karaoke bar in Hollywood and the club played it excessively. This scene was recreated in the ninth-season episode \"\"The Big Bang Theory\"\" with Stewie being the one in the banana.\n[3] Title: \"The Vibrations\" Text:  After a few lineup changes, the group hit again in 1961 with the song \"\"The Watusi\"\" (US #25); concurrently, they had a hit under the name The Marathons with \"\"Peanut Butter\"\" written by Hidle Brown Barnum, Martin Cooper, Fred Smith and Cliff Goldsmith (#20). The group recorded a couple of Northern Soul classics since their initial hit on Atlantic Records in 1963. A cover version of \"\"My Girl Sloopy\"\", retitled \"\"Hang On, Sloopy\"\", was a hit for the McCoys in 1965.\n[4] Title: \"Razzy Bailey\" Text:  It sold over half a million copies before being picked up by MGM Records. In the mid 1970s, Dickey Lee recorded \"\"9,999,999 Tears\"\", and it became a country and pop hit in 1976, and in 1977, Lee repeated this with another Bailey tune, \"\"Peanut Butter,\"\" which also went into the charts. As his songwriting talents became known, Bailey signed with RCA Records and in 1978 began releasing singles of his own songs. His first hit as a singer-songwriter, \"\"What Time Do You Have To Be Back In Heaven?\n[5] Title: \"Hully Gully\" Text:  The same tune appeared in 1961 in a song by the Marathons, entitled \"\"Peanut Butter\"\", which was later used for the Peter Pan Peanut Butter commercial during the 1980s. Tim Morgan sang different lyrics to the song \"\"Peanut Butter\"\" as well, however, only mentioning the Skippy\"\" brand. There was another song about the dance by the Dovells, entitled \"\"Hully Gully Baby\"\". The Jive Five had a hit called \"\"Hully Gully Callin' Time\"\"; Ike & Tina Turner had a song in their repertoire known as \"\"If You Can Hully Gully (I Can Hully Gully Too)\"\".\nQuestion: who wrote the song peanut butter jelly time\nYour answer: ",

Under Helton, USC lost to Notre Dame, but then rallied to win the next four games. A loss to Oregon left the South Division conference championship to be decided by the USC-UCLA game; USC won 40-21. USC played in its first ever Pac-12 Conference championship game, losing to Stanford (41-22) after the Cardinal (8-1 in Pac-12, 9-2 overall) locked up the North Division title, its third in four years, with its victory over California. USC went on to lose the 2015 Holiday Bowl 23\u201321 to the Wisconsin Badgers.\n[2] Title: \"2007 USC Trojans football team\" Text:  Those hopes were dealt a major blow when the Trojans lost to 41-point underdog Stanford in a mid-season game that was named one of the greatest upsets in a season that became defined by them. After their second loss, there were questions as to whether the team would be able to even win their own conference, let alone compete nationally. However, USC defied mid-season expectations and rallied, finishing the season ranked No. 2 in the Coaches' Poll and No. 3 in the Associated Press (AP) Poll. By the end of the season various sports journalists said the Trojans were playing the best football of anyone in the country.\n[3] Title: \"2007 USC Trojans football team\" Text:  The offensive line had been suffering since losing two starters in one play during the previous week's game at Washington, but the effect was severe against Stanford; the offensive line gave up four sacks, one more than the Trojans had surrendered all season, and USC gained only 95 yards rushing. Key receiver Patrick Turner dropped several passes, the defense gave up 17 points in the fourth quarter and USC had an extra-point attempt blocked, a point which became a crucial difference. Like their previous game against Washington, USC out-gained Stanford by 224 yards (459 to 235) but made many crucial turnovers and penalties.\n[4] Title: \"Fresno State Bulldogs football\" Text:  Despite taking a halftime lead and trading scores with the Trojans all night, at the end of regulation, USC's athleticism with Reggie Bush, the Bulldogs lost by a score of 42\u201350. The loss to the Trojans changed the character of the team, who proceeded to lose their next four games, including the Liberty Bowl against Tulsa. The 2006 squad, weakened by key senior losses at quarterback, running back and on the defense, struggled with the schedule, opening the year 1\u20137 before winning three straight, only to close the season with the first loss to San Jose State since before the fall of the Soviet Union.\n[5] Title: \"USC Trojans football\" Text:  The rivalry was renewed with the arrival of Jim Harbaugh at Stanford in 2007. Harbaugh defeated Carroll 2\u20131 in their three matchups with both victories occurring in the Coliseum. In the 2009 meeting, USC sustained their worst loss in 43 years and surrendered the most points to an opponent, a record that would stand for three seasons. The game led the \"\"Los Angeles Times\"\" to declare that Stanford was \"\"at the top of the USC 'Must Kill' list.\"\" Harbaugh added another win in 2010 against Carroll's successor Lane Kiffin before leaving after that season to become head coach of the San Francisco 49ers.\nQuestion: who did usc lose to this year in football\nYour answer: ",

These opinions are then translated into French for the benefit of the judges and their deliberations. All the EU's judicial bodies are based in Luxembourg City, separate from the political institutions in Brussels and Strasbourg. The Court of Justice is based in the Palais building, currently under expansion, in the Kirchberg quarter of Luxembourg City. Luxembourg City was chosen as the provisional seat of the Court on 23 July 1952 with the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community.\n[2] Title: \"European Court of Justice\" Text:  European Court of Justice The European Court of Justice (ECJ), officially just the Court of Justice (), is the supreme court of the European Union in matters of European Union law. As a part of the Court of Justice of the European Union it is tasked with interpreting EU law and ensuring its equal application across all EU member states. The Court was established in 1952 and is based in Luxembourg. It is composed of one judge per member state \u2013 currently 28 \u2013 although it normally hears cases in panels of three, five or 15 judges.\n[3] Title: \"European Court of Justice\" Text:  Its first hearing there was held on 28 November 1954 in a building known as Villa Vauban, the seat until 1959 when it would move to the C\u00f4te d'Eich building and then to the Palais building in 1972. In 1965, the member states established Luxembourg City as the permanent seat of the Court. Future judicial bodies (Court of First Instance and Civil Service Tribunal) would also be based in the city. The decision was confirmed by the European Council at Edinburgh in 1992. However, there was no reference to future bodies being in Luxembourg City.\n[4] Title: Luxembourg Text:  At the same time, the majority of Luxembourgers have consistently believed that European unity makes sense only in the context of a dynamic transatlantic relationship, and thus have traditionally pursued a pro-NATO, pro-US foreign policy. Luxembourg is the site of the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Auditors, the Statistical Office of the European Communities (\"\"Eurostat\"\") and other vital EU organs. The Secretariat of the European Parliament is located in Luxembourg, but the Parliament usually meets in Brussels and sometimes in Strasbourg. The Army is situated on the \"\"H\u00e4rebierg\"\" which is Luxemburgish and translates to \"\"men's mountain\"\".\n[5] Title: \"Institutional seats of the European Union\" Text:  The European Court of Justice, the General Court, and the Court of Auditors are based in Luxembourg City along with the European Investment Bank. The Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions are entirely based in Brussels while the European Central Bank is based in Frankfurt and Europol is the only agency to have its seat fixed by the treaties, in The Hague. Separately, the Treaty of Nice establishes Brussels as the venue for all formal summits of the European Council after 2004.

The film was panned by critics for the recasting of the main characters and its story development, and while \"\"The Long Haul\"\" made a modest US$40.1 million worldwide, it emerged as Silverstone's most widely-seen film since \"\"Beauty Shop\"\" (2005).

Truman, proposed that the foreign ministers of China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States \"\"should draft the peace treaties and boundary settlements of Europe\"\", which led to the creation of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the \"\"Big Five\"\", and soon thereafter the establishment of those states as the permanent members of the UNSC.\n[2] Title: \"Allies of World War II\" Text:  The alliance was formalised by the Declaration by United Nations, from 1 January 1942. However, the name United Nations was rarely used to describe the Allies during the war. The leaders of the \"\"Big Three\"\"\u2014the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014controlled Allied strategy; relations between the United Kingdom and the United States were especially close.

These four countries were referred as the \"\"Four Policemen\"\" of the Allies and considered as the primary victors of World War II.

In August 1920 the report of the Palin Commission, the first in a long line of British Commissions of Inquiry on the question of Palestine during the Mandate period, noted that \"\"The Balfour Declaration... is undoubtedly the starting point of the whole trouble\"\".

Congress obliged his request less than an hour later. On December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, even though the Tripartite Pact did not require it. Congress issued a declaration of war against Germany and Italy later that same day. The UK actually declared war on Japan nine hours before the U.S. did, partially due to Japanese attacks on Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong, and partially due to Winston Churchill's promise to declare war \"\"within the hour\"\" of a Japanese attack on the United States.\n[2] Title: \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\" Text:  In a nearly unanimous vote, Congress declared war on Japan. After the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor, antiwar sentiment in the United States largely evaporated overnight. On December 11, 1941, Hitler and Mussolini declared war on the United States, which responded in kind. A majority of scholars have rejected the conspiracy theories that Roosevelt, or any other high government officials, knew in advance about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese had kept their secrets closely guarded. Senior American officials were aware that war was imminent, but they did not expect an attack on Pearl Harbor.\n[3] Title: \"Military history of the United States during World War II\" Text:  Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt officially pronounced 7 December 1941, as \"\"a date which will live in infamy\"\" and asked for a declaration of war on Japan before a joint session of Congress on 8 December 1941. The motion passed with only one vote against it, in both chambers. Just three days later, on 11 December 1941 Adolf Hitler declared war on the United States, and had already remarked on the evening of the date of the Japanese attack that \"\"We can't lose the war at all.\n[4] Title: \"Attack on Pearl Harbor\" Text:  One Japanese sailor, Kazuo Sakamaki, was captured. The surprise attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan, and several days later, on December 11, Germany and Italy each declared war on the U.S. The U.S. responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been fading since the Fall of France in 1940, disappeared.\n[5] Title: \"Allies of World War II\" Text:  The US strongly supported the Nationalist Government in China in its war with Japan, and provided military equipment, supplies, and volunteers to the Nationalist Government of China to assist in its war effort. In December 1941 Japan opened the war with its attack on Pearl Harbor, the US declared war on Japan, and Japan's allies Germany and Italy declared war on the US, bringing the US into World War II. On 8 December 1941, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States Congress declared war on Japan at the request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nQuestion: who declared war on japan after pearl harbor\nYour answer: ",

As of the 2010 census, the population was 52,274. Its county seat is Waynesville. The county was organized in 1833 and named for Kazimierz Pu\u0142aski, a Polish patriot who died fighting in the American Revolution. Pulaski County is the site of Fort Leonard Wood, a U.S. Army training base. It comprises the Fort Leonard Wood, MO Micropolitan Statistical Area which has nearly one-third of the total county population.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Pacific War\" Text:  Midway proved to be the last great naval battle for two years. The United States used the ensuing period to turn its vast industrial potential into increased numbers of ships, planes, and trained aircrew. At the same time, Japan, lacking an adequate industrial base or technological strategy, a good aircrew training program, or adequate naval resources and commerce defense, fell further and further behind. In strategic terms the Allies began a long movement across the Pacific, seizing one island base after another. Not every Japanese stronghold had to be captured; some, like Truk, Rabaul, and Formosa, were neutralized by air attack and bypassed.\n[2] Title: \"Technology during World War II\" Text:  The Japanese destroyers of World War II are said to be the world's first modern destroyer. The German U-boats were used primarily for stopping/destroying the resources from the United States and Canada coming across the Atlantic. Submarines were critical in the Pacific Ocean as well as in the Atlantic Ocean. Advances in submarine technology included the snorkel. Japanese defenses against Allied submarines were ineffective. Much of the merchant fleet of the Empire of Japan, needed to supply its scattered forces and bring supplies such as petroleum and food back to the Japanese Archipelago, was sunk.\n[3] Title: \"Technology during World War II\" Text:  Examples of bolt-action rifles that were used during World War II include the German Mauser Kar98k, the British Lee\u2013Enfield No.4, and the Springfield M1903A3. During the course of World War II, bolt-action rifles and carbines were modified even further to meet new forms of warfare the armies of certain nations faced e.g. urban warfare and jungle warfare. Examples include the Soviet Mosin\u2013Nagant M1944 carbine, which were developed by the Soviets as a result of the Red Army's experiences with urban warfare e.g. the Battle of Stalingrad, and the British Lee\u2013Enfield No.5 carbine, that were developed for British and Commonwealth forces fighting the Japanese in South-East Asia and the Pacific.\n[4] Title: \"Institutions in the Southern Victory Series\" Text:  A third mission of navies was to provide supplies to rebels and guerrilla forces fighting enemy nations. In the Great War, the U.S. supplied rifles and machine guns to Ireland; the Pacific War was triggered by the U.S. discovery of Japanese supplies to British Columbia; and in the Second Great War, the British did the same for Canada and Newfoundland. New technologies were developed during the years between the Great War and the Pacific War. The aircraft carrier developed into a mature technology, and so did the \"\"Y-range\"\", the term used in this timeline for radar.\n[5] Title: \"Naval tactics in the Age of Steam\" Text:  The American submarine campaign in the Pacific contains many parallels with the German submarine campaign in the Atlantic. Like the Germans, the Americans began the war with a flawed weapon \u2013 faulty torpedoes \u2013 that undermined morale and took more than a year to fix. American submariners developed the same preference for attacking on the surface at night and similar pack tactics, although American wolf packs rarely exceeded three boats. But in the Pacific, it was the submarines, not the escorts, that benefited from the introduction of new technologies like radar.\nQuestion: what new technology helped win the war in the pacific\nYour answer: ",

A camp was set up and the flag raised at Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, on 26 January 1788, a date which became Australia's national day, Australia Day. A British settlement was established in Van Diemen's Land, now known as Tasmania, in 1803, and it became a separate colony in 1825.\n[2] Title: \"Arthur Phillip\" Text:  Most of the 772 convicts (of whom 732 survived the voyage) were petty thieves from the London slums. Phillip was accompanied by a contingent of marines and a handful of other officers who were to administer the colony. The 11 ships of the First Fleet set sail on 13 May 1787. The leading ship, reached Botany Bay setting up camp on the Kurnell Peninsula, on 18 January 1788. Phillip soon decided that this site, chosen on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks, who had accompanied James Cook in 1770, was not suitable, since it had poor soil, no secure anchorage and no reliable water source.\n[3] Title: \"Colony of New South Wales\" Text:  On morning of 26 January, men on board this ship went ashore and started clearing land for a camp. In the afternoon-evening, they erected a flag pole, raised the Union Jack, and the officers ashore made toasts to the Royal Family and the success of the colony. Likely, some, or all, ships of the First Fleet were present for the flag raising. On the morning of the 27th January, all the fit male convicts, marines, and likely some ships' crew went ashore to establish the camp and find food, especially that having what today we call vitamin C. The female convicts came ashore on 6 February 1788 and likely officers wives and children if any.\n[4] Title: \"First Fleet\" Text:  The site selected for the anchorage had deep water close to the shore, was sheltered, and had a small stream flowing into it. Phillip named it Sydney Cove, after Lord Sydney the British Home Secretary. This date is celebrated as Australia Day, marking the beginning of British settlement. The British flag was planted and formal possession taken. This was done by Phillip and some officers and marines from the \"\"Supply\"\", with the remainder of \"\"Supply\"\"s crew and the convicts observing from on board ship.\n[5] Title: \"St George (Sydney)\" Text:  At the time of the arrival of the First Fleet, the Eora tribe inhabited land from Port Jackson to Botany Bay and the Georges River. There is evidence to suggest that these people belonged to the Gweagal, Bidjigal and Cadigal clans. James Cook sailed HMS \"\"Endeavour\"\" into Botany Bay in 1770 for his first landing on the continent of Australia. Captain Arthur Phillip led the First Fleet into the bay on 18 January 1788 to found a penal colony there but found the sandy infertile soil disappointing and moved the site of the settlement north to the natural harbour of Port Jackson.\nQuestion: where did the first fleet set up camp\nYour answer: ",

Through to the 1950s and 1960s, discussions in translation studies tended to concern how best to attain \"\"equivalence\"\". The term \"\"equivalence\"\" had two distinct meanings, corresponding to different schools of thought. In the Russian tradition, \"\"equivalence\"\" was usually a one-to-one correspondence between linguistic forms, or a pair of authorized technical terms or phrases, such that \"\"equivalence\"\" was opposed to a range of \"\"substitutions\"\".\n[2] Title: \"School of Salamanca\" Text:  Finally, and perhaps most originally, was the consideration of \"\"money itself\"\" as a merchandise, and the use of one's money as something for which one should receive a benefit in the form of interest. Mart\u00edn de Azpilcueta also considered the effect of time, formulating the time value of money. All things being equal, one would prefer to receive a given good now rather than in the future. This preference indicates greater value. Interest, under this theory, is the payment for the time the loaning individual is deprived of the money.\n[3] Title: \"Foundations of mathematics\" Text:  Both meanings may apply if the formalized version of the argument forms the proof of a surprising truth. For instance, Russell's paradox may be expressed as \"\"there is no set of all sets\"\" (except in some marginal axiomatic set theories). Various schools of thought opposed each other. The leading school was that of the formalist approach, of which David Hilbert was the foremost proponent, culminating in what is known as Hilbert's program, which thought to ground mathematics on a small basis of a logical system proved sound by metamathematical finitistic means.\n[4] Title: \"Van Hiele model\" Text:  Abstraction: At this level, properties are ordered. The objects of thought are geometric properties, which the student has learned to connect deductively. The student understands that properties are related and one set of properties may imply another property. Students can reason with simple arguments about geometric figures. A student at this level might say, \"\"Isosceles triangles are symmetric, so their base angles must be equal.\"\" Learners recognize the relationships between types of shapes. They recognize that all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares, and they understand why squares are a type of rectangle based on an understanding of the properties of each.\n[5] Title: \"Equality (mathematics)\" Text:  Equality (mathematics) In mathematics, equality is a relationship between two quantities or, more generally two mathematical expressions, asserting that the quantities have the same value, or that the expressions represent the same mathematical object.

The foundation stone of New Delhi was laid by King George V and Queen Mary at the site of Delhi Durbar of 1911 at Kingsway Camp on 15 December 1911, during their imperial visit. Large parts of New Delhi were planned by Edwin Lutyens, who first visited Delhi in 1912, and Herbert Baker, both leading 20th-century British architects.\n[2] Title: \"Kingsway Camp\" Text:  During the British Raj it acquired historic importance due to the presence of the \"\"Coronation Park\"\" close by, now close to the Nirankari Colony, where all the three Delhi Durbar took place, and is now host the Coronation Memorial. Though the most important event took place on 12 December 1911, when George V, the then Emperor of India along with Queen Mary, during the Delhi Durbar, made the announcement that the capital of the Raj was to be shifted from Calcutta to Delhi, subsequently on 15 December 1911, they laid the foundation stone for Viceroy's residence, and New Delhi here, which was subsequently shifted to its present location on Raisina Hill near Rashtrapati Bhavan (President's House).\n[3] Title: \"George V\" Text:  Later in 1911, the King and Queen travelled to India for the Delhi Durbar, where they were presented to an assembled audience of Indian dignitaries and princes as the Emperor and Empress of India on 12 December 1911. George wore the newly created Imperial Crown of India at the ceremony, and declared the shifting of the Indian capital from Calcutta to Delhi. He was the only Emperor of India to be present at his own Delhi Durbar. They travelled throughout the sub-continent, and George took the opportunity to indulge in big game hunting in Nepal, shooting 21 tigers, 8 rhinoceroses and a bear over 10 days.\n[4] Title: \"History of Delhi\" Text:  The city received significant damage during the 1857 siege. Afterwards, the last titular Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar II was exiled to Rangoon and the remaining Mughal territories were annexed as a part of British India. Calcutta was declared the capital of British India but in 1911 at the Delhi Durbar of 1911, held at the Coronation Park, King George V announced the shifting of the capital back to Delhi. Parts of the old city were New Delhi, a monumental new quarter of the city designed by the British architect Edwin Lutyens to house the government buildings was inaugurated in 1931 after its construction was delayed due to World War I.\n[5] Title: \"New Delhi\" Text:  The National Capital Region is a much larger entity comprising the entire NCT along with adjoining districts in neighboring states. Calcutta (now Kolkata) was the capital of India during the British Raj, until December 1911. Calcutta had become the centre of the nationalist movements since the late nineteenth century, which led to the Partition of Bengal by then Viceroy of British India, Lord Curzon. This created massive political and religious upsurge including political assassinations of British officials in Calcutta. The anti-colonial sentiments amongst the public led to complete boycott of British goods, which forced the colonial government to reunite Bengal and immediately shift the capital to New Delhi.\nQuestion: when was india capital shifted from calcutta to delhi\nYour answer: ",

Barbarian invasions came in the wake of civil war, plague, and famine. Pressures from climate change forced various barbarian tribes to push into Roman territory. Other tribes coalesced into more formidable entities (notably the Alamanni and Franks), or were pushed out of their former territories by more dangerous peoples such as the Huns.\n[2] Title: \"Crisis of the Third Century\" Text:  The Senate, fearing Imperial wrath, raised two of their own as co-Emperors, Pupienus and Balbinus with Gordian I's grandson Gordian III as \"\"Caesar\"\". Maximinus marched on Rome but was assassinated by his Legio II Parthica, and subsequently Pupienus and Balbinus were murdered by the Praetorian Guard. In the following years, numerous generals of the Roman army fought each other for control of the empire and neglected their duties of defending it from invasion. There were frequent raids across the Rhine and Danube frontier by foreign tribes, including the Carpians, Goths, Vandals, and Alamanni, and attacks from Sassanids in the east.\n[3] Title: \"Crisis of the Third Century\" Text:  Eventually, the frontiers would be stabilized by the Illyrian Emperors. However, barbarian migrations into the empire would continue in greater and greater numbers. Though these migrants would initially be closely monitored and assimilated, later tribes would eventually enter the Roman Empire en masse with their weapons, giving only token recognition of Roman authority. The defensive battles that Rome had to endure on the Danube since the 230s, however, paled in comparison to the threat the empire faced in the East. There, Sassanid Persia represented a far greater danger to Rome than the isolated attacks of Germanic tribes.\n[4] Title: \"Crisis of the Third Century\" Text:  The Sassanids had in 224 and 226 overthrown the Parthian Arsacids, and the Persian King Ardashir I, who also wanted to prove his legitimacy through military successes, had already penetrated into Roman territory at the time of Severus Alexander, probably taking the strategically important cities of Nisibis and Carrhae. Internally, the empire faced hyperinflation caused by years of coinage devaluation. This had started earlier under the Severan emperors who enlarged the army by one quarter, and doubled the base pay of legionaries. As each of the short-lived emperors took power, they needed ways to raise money quickly to pay the military's \"\"accession bonus\"\" and the easiest way to do so was by inflating the coinage severely, a process made possible by debasing the coinage with bronze and copper.\n[5] Title: \"Legio III Parthica\" Text:  A first indecisive campaign was led by Emperor Caracalla in 217, during which he was assassinated. In 230, the Sassanids invaded the Roman province, defeating the Third. The Emperor Alexander Severus then organized a successful campaign to restore Roman rule over Mesopotamia. Emperor Gordian III organized another campaign in 243, and the Third won the Battle of Resaena, but in the following year Gordian died during the campaign, and his successor Philip the Arab, whose position had been confirmed by Shapur I, retreated. The Sassanids marked a major victory in 256, when they defeated the XV \"\"Apollinaris\"\" and conquered its fortress, Satala, sacking Trapezus in 258.\nQuestion: who invaded roman territory in the third century\nYour answer: ",

He is a two-time Daytona 500 winner, having won the races exactly 10 years apart (2004 and 2014), and has won the Most Popular Driver Award fifteen times (consecutively from 2003\u20132017). He has an estimated net worth of $400 million. After driving the No. 8 Chevrolet for Dale Earnhardt, Inc. (DEI), his father's team in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, for much of his early Cup career, he moved to Hendrick Motorsports to drive the No.\n[2] Title: \"Dale Earnhardt Jr.\" Text:  After a six-hour and 22-minute red flag, Earnhardt's car came alive, taking the lead with 70 laps remaining. He led 54 of the last 70 laps and he held off Denny Hamlin and Brad Keselowski to win his second Daytona 500, just 10 years after his first one. The following week at Phoenix, Earnhardt continued his momentum, finishing 2nd to Kevin Harvick. At Las Vegas, Earnhardt gambled on fuel in the remaining 40 laps, but he ran out of gas while leading on the last lap, finishing 2nd to eventual race winner Brad Keselowski.\n[3] Title: \"Dale Earnhardt\" Text:  Despite no wins, the RCR team finished the season fifth in the final standings. 1998 saw Earnhardt finally win the Daytona 500 in his 20th attempt after being shut out in his previous 19 attempts. He began the season by winning his Twin 125-mile qualifier race for the ninth straight year, and the week before was the first to drive around the track under the newly installed lights, for coincidentally 20 times. On race day, he showed himself to be a contender early. Halfway through the race, however, it seemed that Jeff Gordon had the upper hand.\n[4] Title: \"Dale Earnhardt\" Text:  Earnhardt did not win again in 1996 but still finished fourth in the standings behind Terry Labonte, Jeff Gordon, and Dale Jarrett. David Smith departed as crew chief of the No. 3 team and RCR at the end of the year for personal reasons, and he was replaced by Larry McReynolds. In 1997, Earnhardt went winless for only the second time in his career. The only (non-points) win came during Speedweeks at Daytona in the Twin 125-mile qualifying race, his record eighth-straight win in the event. Once again in the hunt for the Daytona 500 with 10 laps to go, Earnhardt was taken out of contention by a late crash which sent his car upside down on the backstretch.\n[5] Title: \"PowerShares QQQ 300\" Text:  Since its inception, due to its prestige and prominent position on the Speedweeks calendar, the race has long attracted Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series regulars. Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series regulars have dominated the race since 1981, winning all but nine runnings. Notable Cup regulars who have won the race multiple times include Dale Earnhardt (7 wins), Tony Stewart (7), Darrell Waltrip (5), and Dale Earnhardt Jr. (3). On four occasions, the driver of the race has gone on to win the Daytona 500, which is typically run on the following day: Bobby Allison (1988), Darrell Waltrip (1989), Dale Earnhardt Jr. (2004), Kevin Harvick (2007).\nQuestion: how many times did dale earnhardt win daytona\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Old South Church\" Text:  Members of the congregation have included Samuel Adams, William Dawes, Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Sewall, and Phillis Wheatley. In 1773, Samuel Adams gave the signals from the Old South Meeting House for the \"\"war whoops\"\" that started the Boston Tea Party. During the Unitarian Movement of the early 19th century, Old South was the sole Congregational Church in Boston to adhere to the doctrine of Trinitarianism. In 1816 Old South Church joined with Park Street Church to form the City Mission Society, a social justice society to serve Boston's urban poor.\n[2] Title: \"Boston Tea Party\" Text:  After receiving a report that Governor Hutchinson had again refused to let the ships leave, Adams announced that \"\"This meeting can do nothing further to save the country.\"\" According to a popular story, Adams's statement was a prearranged signal for the \"\"tea party\"\" to begin. However, this claim did not appear in print until nearly a century after the event, in a biography of Adams written by his great-grandson, who apparently misinterpreted the evidence. According to eyewitness accounts, people did not leave the meeting until ten or fifteen minutes after Adams's alleged \"\"signal\"\", and Adams in fact tried to stop people from leaving because the meeting was not yet over.\n[3] Title: \"Boston Tea Party\" Text:  He convinced the tea consignees, two of whom were his sons, not to back down. When the tea ship \"\"Dartmouth\"\", arrived in the Boston Harbor in late November, Whig leader Samuel Adams called for a mass meeting to be held at Faneuil Hall on November 29, 1773. Thousands of people arrived, so many that the meeting was moved to the larger Old South Meeting House. British law required \"\"Dartmouth\"\" to unload and pay the duties within twenty days or customs officials could confiscate the cargo (i.e.\n[4] Title: \"Boston Tea Party\" Text:  unload it onto American soil). The mass meeting passed a resolution, introduced by Adams and based on a similar set of resolutions promulgated earlier in Philadelphia, urging the captain of \"\"Dartmouth\"\" to send the ship back without paying the import duty. Meanwhile, the meeting assigned twenty-five men to watch the ship and prevent the tea \u2013 including a number of chests from Davison, Newman and Co. of London \u2013 from being unloaded. Governor Hutchinson refused to grant permission for \"\"Dartmouth\"\" to leave without paying the duty.\n[5] Title: \"Tea Act\" Text:  The company's authorised consignees were harassed, and in many colonies successful efforts were made to prevent the tea from being landed. In Boston, this resistance culminated in the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773, when colonists (some disguised as Native Americans, since they identified themselves as \u201cAmericans\u201d and no longer considered themselves British subjects) boarded tea ships anchored in the harbour and dumped their tea cargo overboard. Parliamentary reaction to this event included passage of the Coercive Acts, designed to punish Massachusetts for its resistance, and the appointment of General Thomas Gage as royal governor of Massachusetts.\nQuestion: who gave the signal for the boston tea party\nYour answer: ",

It won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song in 1986. Once Giorgio Moroder wrote the musical backing to what would become \"\"Take My Breath Away\"\", lyricist Tom Whitlock wrote the lyrics driving home from the studio, and then spent a few hours at home polishing them.\n[2] Title: \"Top Gun\" Text:  Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock worked on numerous songs including the Oscar-winning \"\"Take My Breath Away\"\". Kenny Loggins performed two songs on the soundtrack, \"\"Playing with the Boys\"\", and \"\"Danger Zone\"\". Berlin recorded the song \"\"Take My Breath Away\"\", which would later win numerous awards, sending the band to international acclaim. After the release of Loggins's single \"\"Danger Zone\"\", sales of the album exploded, selling 7 million in the United States alone.\n[3] Title: \"Take My Breath Away\" Text:  Whitlock made a few lyrical changes before Terri Nunn recorded the vocals. Moroder has said that of all the hits he has had in his career, he is most proud of this song. \"\"Take My Breath Away\"\" was the second single from the \"\"Top Gun\"\" soundtrack album, following Kenny Loggins' \"\"Danger Zone,\"\" and was released in 1986 as a split single alongside the song \"\"Radar Radio\"\": The song peaked at number one on the \"\"Billboard\"\" Hot 100, and also topped the charts in Canada, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Belgium.\n[4] Title: \"Terri Nunn\" Text:  In 1979, she played a part in the short-lived TV series \"\"Time Express\"\". She joined Berlin in 1978 and temporarily left the group the following year to pursue an acting career. In 1981, she rejoined Berlin as the lead vocalist and soon forged her recording career in the band. Her greatest success in Berlin was the top-selling 1986 single \"\"Take My Breath Away\"\", the theme song for the film \"\"Top Gun\"\". It reached the no. 1 spot on the \"\"Billboard\"\" Hot 100.\n[5] Title: \"Berlin (band)\" Text:  \"\"Take My Breath Away\"\" (from the movie \"\"Top Gun\"\") became their best-selling single in 1986 and a huge international hit, but also their last big hit.

Both were acquitted by the senate: Johnson by one vote, and Clinton by 17 votes. Additionally, the House Judiciary Committee commenced impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon in 1974; however, he resigned from office before the full House voted on the articles of impeachment.

Only two presidents have ever been impeached: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999. Both trials ended in acquittal; in Johnson's case, the Senate fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction. In 1974, Richard Nixon resigned from office after impeachment proceedings in the House Judiciary Committee indicated he would eventually be removed from office. The Senate has an important check on the executive power by confirming Cabinet officials, judges, and other high officers \"\"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.\"\"\n[3] Title: \"Impeachment of Bill Clinton\" Text:  Clinton thus became the second U.S. president to be impeached, following Andrew Johnson in 1868. (Clinton was the third sitting president against whom the House of Representatives initiated impeachment proceedings since 1789.) Five Democrats (Virgil Goode of Virginia, Ralph Hall of Texas, Paul McHale of Pennsylvania, Charles Stenholm of Texas and Gene Taylor of Mississippi) voted in favor of three of the four articles of impeachment, but only Taylor voted for the abuse of power charge. Five Republicans (Amo Houghton of New York, Peter King of New York, Connie Morella of Maryland, Chris Shays of Connecticut and Mark Souder of Indiana) voted against the first perjury charge.\n[4] Title: \"Impeachment of Bill Clinton\" Text:  Leading to the impeachment, Independent Counsel Ken Starr turned over documentation to the House Judiciary Committee. Chief Prosecutor David Schippers and his team reviewed the material and determined there was sufficient evidence to impeach the president. As a result, four charges were considered by the full House of Representatives; two passed, making Clinton the second president to be impeached, after Andrew Johnson in 1868, and only the third against whom articles of impeachment had been brought before the full House for consideration (Richard Nixon resigned from the presidency in 1974, while an impeachment process against him was underway).\n[5] Title: \"Bill Clinton\" Text:  In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for perjury and obstruction of justice following allegations that he committed perjury and obstructed justice to conceal an affair he had with Monica Lewinsky, a 22-year old White House intern. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and completed his term in office. He is only the second U.S. president to ever be impeached, the first being Andrew Johnson.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Banana Text:  Bananas were introduced to the Americas by Portuguese sailors who brought the fruits from West Africa in the 16th century. Many wild banana species as well as cultivars exist in extraordinary diversity in India, China, and Southeast Asia. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Portuguese colonists started banana plantations in the Atlantic Islands, Brazil, and western Africa. North Americans began consuming bananas on a small scale at very high prices shortly after the Civil War, though it was only in the 1880s that the food became more widespread. As late as the Victorian Era, bananas were not widely known in Europe, although they were available.\n[2] Title: \"Columbian exchange\" Text:  Bananas were introduced to the Americas by Portuguese sailors who brought the fruits from West Africa during their enslavement of Africans in the 16th century. Bananas were still only consumed in minimal amounts around the 1880's. The U.S. didn't see major rises in banana consumption until banana plantations in the Caribbean grew. The History of modern banana plantations in the Americas details the spread of this crop within the Americas. It took three centuries after their introduction in Europe for tomatoes to become widely accepted. Tobacco, potatoes, chili peppers, tomatillos, and tomatoes are all members of the nightshade family and all of these plants bear some resemblance to the European nightshade that even an amateur could deduce just by simple observation of the flowers and berries; tomatoes and potatoes can be quite lethal if the wrong part of the plant is consumed at the wrong quantity or at least cause a person to experience copious amounts of vomiting and diarrhea.\n[3] Title: Banana Text:  Jules Verne introduces bananas to his readers with detailed descriptions in \"\"Around the World in Eighty Days\"\" (1872). The earliest modern plantations originated in Jamaica and the related Western Caribbean Zone, including most of Central America. It involved the combination of modern transportation networks of steamships and railroads with the development of refrigeration that allowed more time between harvesting and ripening. North American shippers like Lorenzo Dow Baker and Andrew Preston, the founders of the Boston Fruit Company started this process in the 1870s, but railroad builders like Minor C. Keith also participated, eventually culminating in the multi-national giant corporations like today's Chiquita Brands International and Dole.\n[4] Title: \"Banana bread\" Text:  National Banana Bread day is 23 February. Bananas appeared in the US in the 1870s and it took a while for them to appear as ingredient items for desserts. The modern banana bread recipe began being published in cookbooks around the 1930s and its popularity was greatly helped by the introduction of baking powder on the market. Some food historians believe banana bread was a byproduct of the Great Depression as resourceful housewives did not wish to throw away overripe bananas (as they were still a costly item to purchase), others believe the modern banana bread was developed in corporate kitchens to promote flour and baking soda products.\n[5] Title: \"Banana bread\" Text:  Banana bread Banana bread is a type of bread made from mashed bananas. It is often a moist, sweet, cake-like quick bread; however, there are some banana bread recipes that are traditional-style raised breads. Banana bread first became a standard feature of American cookbooks with the popularization of baking soda and baking powder in the 1930s. It appeared in Pillsbury's 1933 \"\"Balanced Recipes\"\" cookbook, and later gained more acceptance with the release of the original \"\"Chiquita Banana's Recipe Book\"\" in 1950.\nQuestion: when did bananas become popular in the us\nYour answer: ",

A peace treaty with Japan was signed in 1951. A treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place in 1990 and resolved most post-World War II issues. No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed. World War I had radically altered the political European map, with the defeat of the Central Powers\u2014including Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire\u2014and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, which eventually led to the founding of the Soviet Union.\n[2] Title: \"End of World War II in Asia\" Text:  End of World War II in Asia The end of World War II in Asia occurred on 14 and 15 August 1945, when armed forces of the Empire of Japan surrendered to the forces of the Allies.

The latter was divided into western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union.

In seeking to enact \"\"O Canada\"\" as the national anthem officially, a Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons was struck. In 1968, the committee recommended changes to the English version\u2013replacing one of the repeated phrases \"\"We stand on guard for thee\"\" with \"\"From far and wide\"\" and one \"\"O Canada\"\" with \"\"God keep our land\"\".\n[4] Title: \"Robert Stanley Weir\" Text:  O Canada!

It differs from other summaries of Christian doctrine for the instruction of the people in two points: it is primarily intended for priests having care of souls (\"\"ad parochos\"\"), and it enjoyed an authority within the Catholic Church equalled by no other catechism until the \"\"Catechism of the Catholic Church\"\" (1992).\n[2] Title: \"Faith and rationality\" Text:  The Council of Trent's catechism\u2014the \"\"Roman Catechism\"\", written during the Catholic Church's Counter-Reformation to combat Protestantism and Martin Luther's antimetaphysical tendencies. \"\"Dei Filius\"\" was a dogmatic constitution of the First Vatican Council on the Roman Catholic faith. It was adopted unanimously on 24 April 1870 and was influenced by the philosophical conceptions of Johann Baptist Franzelin, who had written a great deal on the topic of faith and rationality. Because the Roman Catholic Church does not disparage reason, but rather affirms its veracity and utility, there have been many Catholic scientists over the ages.\n[3] Title: \"Baltimore Catechism\" Text:  As early as 1829, the bishops assembled in the First Provincial Council of Baltimore decreed: \"\"A catechism shall be written which is better adapted to the circumstances of this Province; it shall give the Christian Doctrine as explained in Cardinal Bellarmine's Catechism (1597), and when approved by the Holy See, it shall be published for the common use of Catholics\"\" (Decr. xxxiii).

It is based on the Roman Catechism of the Council of Trent and was similarly written with the purpose of teaching Christian doctrine during the tumultuous English Reformation. It is a testament to Rev. Tuberville and his colleagues at Douay that it remains one of the clearest and most direct compendiums of Catholic teaching in the English language. The Catechism for Filipino Catholics (CFC) is a contextualised and inculturated Roman Catholic catechism for Filipinos prepared by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines and approved by the Holy See.\n[5] Title: \"Baltimore Catechism\" Text:  The \"\"Baltimore Catechism\"\" became the standard text for Catholic education in the United States for the next four generations. Since the 1960s, many Catholic churches and schools have moved away from catechism-based education. The standard edition was created by Fr. Januarius De Concilio during the Council and published on April 6, 1885. This catechism contained 421 questions.

Just as they decide to leave, Roger finally turns up with a car antenna as his weapon, and the greasers criticize him for showing up so late with such a pathetic excuse for a weapon.\n[4] Title: \"Grease (film)\" Text:  The exterior Rydell scenes, including the basketball, baseball and track segments, were shot at Venice High School in Venice, California, while the Rydell interiors, including the high school dance, were filmed at Huntington Park High School.

Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built. The Pyramid of Khufu at Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence. By the time of the Early Dynastic Period, those with sufficient means were buried in bench-like structures known as mastabas.

The current women's world record of 10.49 s was set by Florence Griffith-Joyner of the US, at the 1988 United States Olympic Trials in Indianapolis, Indiana, on 16 July 1988 breaking Evelyn Ashford's four-year-old world record by .27 seconds. The extraordinary nature of this result and those of several other sprinters in this race raised the possibility of a technical malfunction with the wind gauge which read at 0.0 m/s- a reading which was at complete odds to the windy conditions on the day with high wind speeds being recorded in all other sprints before and after this race as well as the parallel long jump runway at the time of the Griffith-Joyner performance.\n[2] Title: \"100 metres\" Text:  The current men's world record is 9.58 seconds, set by Jamaica's Usain Bolt in 2009, while the women's world record of 10.49 seconds set by American Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988 remains unbroken. The 100 m (109.361 yards) emerged from the metrication of the 100 yards (91.44 m), a now defunct distance originally contested in English-speaking countries. The event is largely held outdoors as few indoor facilities have a 100 m straight. US athletes have won the men's Olympic 100 metres title more times than any other country, 16 out of the 28 times that it has been run.\n[3] Title: \"Obadele Thompson\" Text:  Usain Bolt holds the 100 m world record at 9.58 sec. Unfortunately, Thompson sustained a groin injury during that race, forcing him to miss practice for a week. Injuries struck again months later in the semifinals of the 100 and 200 metres (groin and hamstring strains, respectively) at the 1996 NCAA Outdoor Championships in Eugene, Oregon. He withdrew from the meet, extinguishing the anticipated showdown with Trinidadian sprinter, Ato Boldon of UCLA. Sidelined by those injuries for three weeks, Thompson\u2019s once bright Olympic prospects darkened grimly as he returned to training with only one month to prepare for his first Olympic Games.\n[4] Title: \"Carl Lewis\" Text:  The IAAF also declared that Lewis had also, therefore, twice tied the \"\"true\"\" world record (9.93 s) for his 1987 World Championship performance, and again at the 1988 Z\u00fcrich meet where he defeated Johnson. However, those times were never ratified as records. From January 1, 1990, Lewis was the world record holder in the 100 m. The record did not last long, as fellow American and University of Houston teammate Leroy Burrell ran 9.90 s on June 14, 1991, to break Lewis's mark.\n[5] Title: \"Carl Lewis\" Text:  A subsequent honor would follow: Lewis eventually was credited with the 100 m world record for the 9.92 s he ran in Seoul. Though Ben Johnson's 9.79 s time was never ratified as a world record, the 9.83 s he ran the year before was. However, in the fallout to the steroid scandal, an inquiry was called in Canada wherein Johnson admitted under oath to long-time steroid use. The IAAF subsequently stripped Johnson of his record and gold medal from the World Championships. Lewis was deemed to be the world record holder for his 1988 Olympic performance and declared the 1987 100 m World Champion.\nQuestion: who holds the world record for 100 meters\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Columbia River\" Text:  The gorge is known for its strong and steady winds, scenic beauty, and its role as an important transportation link. The river continues west, bending sharply to the north-northwest near Portland and Vancouver, Washington, at the Willamette River confluence. Here the river slows considerably, dropping sediment that might otherwise form a river delta. Near Longview, Washington and the Cowlitz River confluence, the river turns west again. The Columbia empties into the Pacific Ocean just west of Astoria, Oregon, over the Columbia Bar, a shifting sandbar that makes the river's mouth one of the most hazardous stretches of water to navigate in the world.\n[2] Title: \"Columbia River Gorge\" Text:  Columbia River Gorge The Columbia River Gorge is a canyon of the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Up to deep, the canyon stretches for over as the river winds westward through the Cascade Range forming the boundary between the State of Washington to the north and Oregon to the south. Extending roughly from the confluence of the Columbia with the Deschutes River (and the towns of Roosevelt, Washington, and Arlington, Oregon) in the east down to the eastern reaches of the Portland metropolitan area, the water gap furnishes the only navigable route through the Cascades and the only water connection between the Columbia River Plateau and the Pacific Ocean.\n[3] Title: \"Snake River\" Text:  The river leaves Hells Canyon and turns west, winding through the Palouse Hills of eastern Washington. The Lower Snake River Project's four dams and navigation locks have transformed this part of the Snake River into a series of reservoirs. The confluence of the Snake and Columbia rivers at Burbank, Washington is part of Lake Wallula, the reservoir of McNary Dam. The Columbia River flows about further west to the Pacific Ocean near Astoria, Oregon. As recently as 165 million years ago, most of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean.\n[4] Title: \"Umatilla River\" Text:  The Umatilla River joins the Columbia at what is called Lake Umatilla, a reservoir formed by the John Day Dam on the Columbia. The confluence is from the Columbia's mouth on the Pacific Ocean at Astoria. McNary Dam, another dam on the Columbia, is slightly upstream at about RM 292 (RK 470). The Umatilla River supports populations of spring Chinook, fall Chinook, and Coho salmon as well as small trout in its upper reaches. Public access to salmon and steelhead fishing is fairly good downstream of the Oregon Route 11 bridge.\n[5] Title: \"Youngs Bay\" Text:  The bay is fished extensively for sturgeon and salmon, when in season. Most of the gillnetting community moors and fishes in Youngs Bay. The bay can be seen rising and falling significantly with the tides created where the bay meets the Columbia River, which meets the Pacific Ocean approximately to the west. Youngs Bay Youngs Bay, or Youngs River Bay, is located in the northwestern corner of the U.S. state of Oregon. The Youngs River meets the Columbia River at this point, which is situated between Astoria and Warrenton.

This name is a reference to the \"\"\u2019\u0101r\u014dn haqq\u014dde\u0161\"\", the Hebrew name for the Ark of the Covenant which was stored in the Holy of Holies in the inner sanctuary of both the ancient Tabernacle and the Temple in Jerusalem. Similarly, Hekh\u00e1l, also written \"\"hechal\"\", \"\"echal\"\" or \"\"heichal\"\" \u2014\n[2] Title: \"Torah ark\" Text:  Torah ark The ark in a synagogue (also called the Torah ark or holy ark) is a receptacle,or ornamental closet, which contains each synagogue's Torah scrolls (\"\"Sifrei Torah\"\" in Hebrew). \"\"Aron kodesh\"\" comes from Hebrew \"\"\u02bc\u0101r\u014dn q\u014dde\u0161\"\" (i.e. \"\"aron kodesh\"\"), \"\"Holy Ark\"\". This name is a reference to the \"\"\u2019\u0101r\u014dn haqq\u014dde\u0161\"\", the Hebrew name for the Ark of the Covenant which was stored in the Holy of Holies in the inner sanctuary of both the ancient Tabernacle and the Temple in Jerusalem.\n[3] Title: \"Torah ark\" Text:  The ark is known in Hebrew as the \"\"aron kodesh\"\" (\"\"holy ark\"\") by the Ashkenazim and as the 'menjia\"\" (\"\"holy place\"\") among most Sefardim. The ark is often placed on the wall of the sanctuary which is facing Jerusalem, though it is sometimes placed on the north wall or another wall for architectural reasons. In those cases where the ark does not show the direction to Jerusalem, traditional Judaism instructs the worshiper to face the true direction towards Jerusalem in prayers such as the Amidah.\n[4] Title: \"Synagogue architecture\" Text:  The almemar in many cases was joined to the platform in front of the Ark, and elaborate arrangements of steps were provided. The Torah Ark (usually called \"\"Aron Hakodesh\"\" or \"\"Hekh\u00e1l\"\") is the most important feature of the interior, and is generally dignified by proper decoration and raised upon a suitable platform, reached by at least three steps, but often by more. It is usually crowned by the Ten Commandments and the Torah. The position of the pulpit varies; it may be placed on either side of the Ark, and is occasionally found in the center of the steps.\n[5] Title: Bema Text:  Bema The bema, or bima, is an elevated platform used as an orator's podium in ancient Athens. In Jewish synagogues, it is also known as a bimah and is for Torah reading during services. In an Orthodox Jewish synagogue, a bema is the raised area around the \"\"aron kodesh\"\", or the sanctuary. In antiquity it was made of stone, but in modern times it is usually a rectangular wooden platform approached by steps. The Ancient Greek \"\"b\u0113ma\"\" () means both 'platform' and 'step', being derived from \"\"bainein\"\" (, \u2018to go\u2019).\nQuestion: what does aron hakodesh refer to in english\nYour answer: ",

The couple had several children, though only one survived past childhood. They soon became involved in the movement to abolish slavery, with Lowell using poetry to express his anti-slavery views and taking a job in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the editor of an abolitionist newspaper. After moving back to Cambridge, Lowell was one of the founders of a journal called \"\"The Pioneer\"\", which lasted only three issues. He gained notoriety in 1848 with the publication of \"\"A Fable for Critics\"\", a book-length poem satirizing contemporary critics and poets.\n[2] Title: \"James Russell Lowell\" Text:  He said that his first book of poetry \"\"A Year's Life\"\" (1841) \"\"owes all its beauty to her\"\", though it only sold 300 copies. Maria's character and beliefs led her to become involved in the movements directed against intemperance and slavery. She was a member of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society and persuaded her husband to become an abolitionist. James had previously expressed antislavery sentiments, but Maria urged him towards more active expression and involvement. His second volume of poems \"\"Miscellaneous Poems\"\" expressed these antislavery thoughts, and its 1,500 copies sold well.\n[3] Title: \"James Russell Lowell\" Text:  Lowell was very affected by the loss of almost all of his children. His grief over the death of his first daughter in particular was expressed in his poem \"\"\"\" (1847). He again considered suicide, writing to a friend that he thought \"\"of my razors and my throat and that I am a fool and a coward not to end it all at once\"\". Lowell's earliest poems were published without remuneration in the \"\"Southern Literary Messenger\"\" in 1840. He was inspired to new efforts towards self-support and joined with his friend Robert Carter in founding the literary journal \"\"The Pioneer\"\".\n[4] Title: \"James Russell Lowell\" Text:  If it be needful to the successful prosecution of the war, shall anyone oppose it?\"\" His interest in the Civil War inspired him to write a second series of \"\"The Biglow Papers\"\", including one specifically dedicated to the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation called \"\"Sunthin' in the Pastoral Line\"\" in 1862. Shortly after Lincoln's assassination, Lowell was asked to present a poem at Harvard in memory of graduates killed in the war. His poem, \"\"Commemoration Ode\"\", cost him sleep and his appetite, but was delivered on July 21, 1865, after a 48-hour writing binge.\n[5] Title: \"James Russell Lowell\" Text:  The first of the twelve-part lecture series was to be on January 9, 1855, though by December, Lowell had only completed writing five of them, hoping for last-minute inspiration. His first lecture was on John Milton and the auditorium was oversold; Lowell had to give a repeat performance the next afternoon. Lowell, who had never spoken in public before, was praised for these lectures. Francis James Child said that Lowell, whom he deemed was typically \"\"perverse\"\", was able to \"\"persist in being serious contrary to his impulses and his talents\"\".\nQuestion: when was the first snowfall by james russell lowell written\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Quirico Filopanti\" Text:  Filopanti's hypothesis was to ideally split up the earth into 24 areas (zones) along the lines of the meridians, each of which should have its own time. Each time zone should differ from the next by one hour, whereas minutes and seconds should coincide. The first time zone should be centred on Rome's meridian. The splitting into time zones should establish the local time (L). His hypothesis provided also with the establishing of a universal time (U) that should be used as only datum line in astronomy and telegraph communications.\n[2] Title: \"Charles F. Dowd\" Text:  In 1869, he presented his idea to a committee of railway superintendents in New York. As a result, in 1870 he published a pamphlet entitled \"\"A System of National Time for Railroads\"\" wherein he proposed four time zones, each 15\u00b0 wide, the time of each being one hour different from the next, named Washington, first, second, and third hours. The central meridian of the first zone was the Washington meridian. The borders of all zones were lines of longitude. In 1872, he modified his proposal so that the first zone was centered on the 75th meridian west of Greenwich, with the others 90\u00b0, 105\u00b0, and 120\u00b0 west of Greenwich.\n[3] Title: \"Time zone\" Text:  The table \"\"Time of day by zone\"\" gives an overview on the time relations between different zones. Since the 1920s a nautical standard time system has been in operation for ships on the high seas. Nautical time zones are an ideal form of the terrestrial time zone system. Under the system, a time change of one hour is required for each change of longitude by 15\u00b0. The 15\u00b0 gore that is offset from GMT or UT1 (not UTC) by twelve hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two 7.5\u00b0 gores that differ from GMT by \u00b112 hours.\n[4] Title: \"Time zone\" Text:  A nautical date line is implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps. It follows the 180th meridian except where it is interrupted by territorial waters adjacent to land, forming gaps: it is a pole-to-pole dashed line. A ship within the territorial waters of any nation would use that nation's standard time, but would revert to nautical standard time upon leaving its territorial waters. The captain is permitted to change the ship's clocks at a time of the captain's choice following the ship's entry into another time zone.\n[5] Title: \"International Date Line\" Text:  These national zones do not extend into international waters. The nautical date line, not the same as the IDL, is a \"\"de jure\"\" construction determined by international agreement. It is the result of the 1917 Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea, which recommended that all ships, both military and civilian, adopt hourly standard time zones on the high seas. The United States adopted its recommendation for U.S. military and merchant marine ships in 1920. This date line is implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps.\nQuestion: what is the line in the middle of a time zone that in theory determines the time of that zone\nYour answer: ",

She is considered to be one of the most independent Disney princesses. Disney claims Pocahontas as a role model to \"\"respect the earth.\"\" Pocahontas is the first Disney Princess based on a real person.

She is the first Disney princess in the line-up to not have a love interest in her film, and the first to not on-screen in her film, as well as the first Pixar character to be included. Further, her stubbornness and independence have generally resonated with feminists, as well as her near entire rejection of \"\"princess duties\"\" like marrying a man and looking proper.\n[3] Title: \"Princess Jasmine\" Text:  Critics also did not appreciate the scene in which Jasmine nearly gets her hand cut off by a merchant as punishment for unintentionally stealing an apple. According to \"\"The Fiscal Times\"\", \"\"Aladdin\"\" is Disney's fourth most profitable princess film in terms of box office returns. Having successfully established herself as a popular character, Jasmine ultimately became one of the original members of the Disney Princess franchise, and remains the only member of the lineup who is not the main character of her film. Consequently, \"\"Aladdin\"\" remains the only Disney Princess film whose featured princess is not its protagonist, and Jasmine became the first Disney Princess to marry a character who is not a prince.\n[4] Title: \"Disney Princess\" Text:  Luckily, after Jafar's defeat, the Sultan permits Jasmine to wed Aladdin despite his lack of royal heritage. Princess Jasmine is voiced by Linda Larkin, animated by Mark Henn, and her singing voice is provided by Lea Salonga (in the feature film) and Liz Callaway (in the direct-to-video sequel).

When Parker and Shaiman declined these requests, Robin Williams, a friend of Shaiman's, sang the song with black tape over his mouth and turning his back when curse words were to be sung. Parker and Stone attended the ceremony in drag, wearing replicas of dresses previously worn at the Oscars by Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez.\n[4] Title: \"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut\" Text:  The next day the film was changed to an R rating without reason, with the original film intact. \"\"The ratings board only cared about the dirty words; they're so confused and arbitrary,\"\" said Parker to \"\"The New York Times\"\" shortly before the release of the picture. \"\"They didn't blink twice because of violence.\"\" During production of the trailer for the film, the raters objected to certain words but had no problem with a scene in which cartoon bullets are killing soldiers.\n[5] Title: \"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut\" Text:  \"\"It was war,\"\" said Stone in 2000. \"\"They were saying, 'Are you telling us how to do our job?'

In response to these findings, many states raised the minimum legal drinking age to 19 (and sometimes to 20 or 21). In 1984, the National Minimum Legal Drinking Act, written by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) and influenced by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), required all states to enforce a minimum legal drinking age of 21 or else risk losing 10% of all federal highway construction funds.\n[2] Title: \"National Minimum Drinking Age Act\" Text:  As the MLDA was still left to the discretion of the state, the act did not violate the 21st amendment which reserved the right to regulate alcohol for all responsibilities not specifically appointed to the federal government to the states. However, as the act controlled the distribution of anywhere from $8 million to $99 million, depending on the size of the state, the act gave a strong incentive for states to change the drinking age to 21. By 1995, all 50 states, two permanently inhabited territories, and D.C. were in compliance, but Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (and Guam until 2010) remained at 18 despite them losing 10% of federal highway funding.\n[3] Title: \"National Minimum Drinking Age Act\" Text:  National Minimum Drinking Age Act The National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 () was passed by the United States Congress on July 17, 1984. It was a controversial bill that punished every state that allowed persons below 21 years to purchase and publicly possess alcoholic beverages by reducing its annual federal highway apportionment by 10 percent. The law was later amended, lowering the penalty to 8 percent from fiscal year 2012 and beyond. Despite its name, this act did not outlaw the \"\"consumption\"\" of alcoholic beverages by those under 21 years of age, just its \"\"purchase\"\".\n[4] Title: \"Mothers Against Drunk Driving\" Text:  A 1983 television movie about Lightner garnered publicity for the group, which grew rapidly. In the early 1980s, the group attracted the attention of the United States Congress. Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) did not like the fact that youth in New Jersey could easily travel to New York to purchase alcoholic beverages, circumventing New Jersey's law restricting consumption to those 21 years old and older. The group had its greatest success with the enacting of a 1984 federal law, the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, that introduced a federal penalty (a 5%\u2014later raised to 10%\u2014loss of federal highway dollars), for states that didn't raise the minimum legal age for the purchase and possession of alcohol to 21.\n[5] Title: \"Richard Lugar\" Text:  Lugar led the February 2, 1984 hearing of William A. Wilson, the nominee of President Reagan for United States Ambassador to the Holy See. In March 1984, Lugar voted in favor of a constitutional amendment authorizing periods in public school for silent prayer, and President Reagan's unsuccessful proposal for a constitutional amendment permitting organized school prayer in public schools. Lugar voted against the May 1984 budget freeze meant to reduce the budget deficit. United States Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole announced President Reagan's support for legislation that would force states to raise the minimum drinking age to 21 during a news conference on June 13, 1984.\nQuestion: when was the drinking age raised to 21\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Two-tier healthcare\" Text:  Healthcare provided directly by the government is limited to military and veteran families and to certain Native American tribes. Certain cities and towns also provide free care directly but only to those who cannot afford to pay. Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program pay for health care obtained at private facilities but only for the elderly, disabled, and children in poor families. Since enacting the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, Medicaid has been substantially expanded, and federal subsidies are available for low- to middle-income individuals and families to purchase private health insurance.\n[2] Title: \"Comparison of the healthcare systems in Canada and the United States\" Text:  Those whose employers do not offer health insurance, as well as those who are self-employed or unemployed, must purchase it on their own. Nearly 27 million of the 45 million uninsured U.S. residents worked at least part-time in 2007, and more than a third were in households that earned $50,000 or more per year. Despite the greater role of private business in the US, federal and state agencies are increasingly involved, paying about 45% of the $2.2 trillion the nation spent on medical care in 2004. The U.S. government spends more on healthcare than on Social Security and national defense combined, according to the Brookings Institution.\n[3] Title: \"Comparison of the healthcare systems in Canada and the United States\" Text:  Healthcare is one of the most expensive items of both nations' budgets. In the United States, the various levels of government spend more per capita than levels of government do in Canada. In 2004, Canada government-spending was $2,120 (in US dollars) per person, while the United States government-spending $2,724. A 1999 report found that after exclusions, administration accounted for 31.0% of healthcare expenditures in the United States, as compared with 16.7% in Canada. In looking at the insurance element, in Canada, the provincial single-payer insurance system operated with overheads of 1.3%, comparing favourably with private insurance overheads (13.2%), U.S. private insurance overheads (11.7%) and U.S. Medicare and Medicaid program overheads (3.6% and 6.8% respectively).\n[4] Title: \"Comparison of the healthcare systems in Canada and the United States\" Text:  The U.S. spent 15.3% of GDP on healthcare in that year; Canada spent 10.0%. In 2006, 70% of healthcare spending in Canada was financed by government, versus 46% in the United States. Total government spending per capita in the U.S. on healthcare was 23% higher than Canadian government spending, and U.S. government expenditure on healthcare was just under 83% of total Canadian spending (public and private) though these statistics don't take into account population differences. Studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in spending.\n[5] Title: \"Health care prices in the United States\" Text:  Medicaid spending rose by $7 billion (2%) in part because of more persons enrolled due to the Affordable Care Act. Unadjusted for timing shifts, in 2017 Medicare spending was $595 billion and Medicaid spending was $375 billion. Medicare covered 57 million people as of September 2016. While on the other hand, Medicaid covered 68.4 million people as of July 2017, 74.3 million including the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

In 1275, the first age of consent was set in England, at age 12 (Westminster 1 statute). In 1875, the Offences Against the Person Act raised the age to 13 in Great Britain and Ireland, and ten years later the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885 raised it to 16.\n[2] Title: \"Age of consent reform in the United Kingdom\" Text:  In 1275, the first age of consent\n[3] Title: \"Age of consent reform\" Text:  Gratian, a canon lawyer in the 12th century, stated that consent could not take place before 7 years of age. The English government eventually decided on age of 12 for women as their limitation. At that time, the age was about 12 in most countries. Today it is usually set between 15 and 18. In 1275, the age of consent in England was set at 12 (Westminster 1 statute), the first time an age of consent had been set in England. However, in 1875 the Offence Against the Persons Act raised it to 13 in Great Britain and Ireland.\n[4] Title: \"Age of consent reform in the United Kingdom\" Text:  The male homosexual age of consent in the United Kingdom was set at 21 in the Sexual Offences Act of 1967 (following the recommendations of the Wolfenden Report), then lowered to 18 in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, and finally lowered to 16 in England and Scotland in the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act of 2000. Currently, the age of consent for penetrative sex, oral sex and mutual masturbation in the United Kingdom is 16 years. If any individual has sex with someone under this age, then he or she may be charged with a criminal offence and may receive a 14-year prison sentence or if they are under 18 a 5-year prison sentence.\n[5] Title: \"Age of consent reform\" Text:  The Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885 raised it to 16. In 1917 a bill raising the age of consent in Great Britain and Ireland from 16 to 17 was defeated by only one vote. In Northern Ireland in 1950 the legislature of Northern Ireland passed a law called Children and Young Persons Act in 1950 that raised the age of consent from 16 to 17. The male homosexual age of consent in the United Kingdom was set at 21 in the Sexual Offences Act of 1967, lowered to 18 in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, and then finally lowered equally to 16 in England and Wales and Scotland in the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act of 2000.\nQuestion: when was the legal age of consent introduced uk\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Deliberation Text:  In countries with a jury system, the jury's deliberation in criminal matters can involve both rendering a verdict and determining the appropriate sentence. In civil cases, the jury decision is whether to agree with the plaintiff or the defendant and rendering a resolution binding actions by the parties based on the results of the trial. Typically, a jury must come to a unanimous decision before delivering a verdict; however, there are exceptions. When a unanimous decision is not reached and the jury feels that one is not possible, they declare themselves a 'hung jury', a mistrial is declared and the trial will have to be redone at the discretion of the plaintiff or prosecutor.\n[2] Title: \"Jury trial\" Text:  A civil jury is typically made up of 6 to 12 persons. In a civil case, the role of the jury is to listen to the evidence presented at a trial, to decide whether the defendant injured the plaintiff or otherwise failed to fulfill a legal duty to the plaintiff, and to determine what the compensation or penalty should be. A criminal jury is usually made up of 12 members, though fewer may sit on cases involving lesser offenses. Criminal juries decide whether the defendant committed the crime as charged. In several southern states, the jury sets punishment, while in most states and at the federal level, it is set by the judge.\n[3] Title: \"Jury trial\" Text:  In the Republic of Ireland, a common law jurisdiction, jury trials are available for criminal cases before the Circuit Court, Central Criminal Court and defamation cases, consisting of twelve jurors. Juries only decide questions of fact; they have no role in criminal sentencing in criminal cases or awarding damages in libel cases. It is not necessary that a jury be unanimous in its verdict. In civil cases, a verdict may be reached by a majority of nine of the twelve members. In a criminal case, a verdict need not be unanimous where there are not fewer than eleven jurors if ten of them agree on a verdict after considering the case for a reasonable time.\n[4] Title: Jury Text:  The final jury is then randomly selected by drawing of lots. Juries are not used in other criminal and civil cases. For most other cases in the first and second tier courts lay judges sit alongside professional judges. Lay judges participate in deciding both the facts of the case and sentencing. Lay judges are appointed by local authorities, or in practice by the political parties represented on the authorities. Lay judges are therefore usually selected from among nominees of ruling political parties. In England and Wales jury trials are used for criminal cases, requiring 12 jurors (between the ages of 18 and 75), although the trial may continue with as few as 9.\n[5] Title: \"Judicial Yuan\" Text:  A panel of three judges decides cases of great importance in ordinary proceedings as well as appeals or interlocutory appeals from the summary and small claims proceedings. Criminal cases are decided by a panel of three judges, with the exception of summary proceedings which may be held by a single judge. The Juvenile Court hears and decides only cases involving juveniles. The current administrative litigation system adopts a \"\"Two Level Two Instance System\"\" litigation procedure. The administrative courts are classified into the High Administrative Court, which is the court of first instance, and the Supreme Administrative Court, which is the appellate court.\nQuestion: who decides the outcome in civil and criminal cases\nYour answer: ",

Students Huey Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party at Merritt College in Oakland Hills neighborhood, which emphasized black power, advocated armed self-defense against police brutality, and was involved in several incidents that ended in the deaths of police officers and other Black Panther members. Among their social programs were feeding children and providing other services to the needy. During the 1970s, Oakland began to suffer serious violence and other problems related to gang-controlled dealing of heroin and cocaine when drug kingpin Felix Mitchell created the nation's first large-scale operation of this kind.\n[2] Title: \"New Haven, Connecticut\" Text:  In 1970, a series of criminal prosecutions against various members of the Black Panther Party took place in New Haven, inciting mass protests on the New Haven Green involving twelve thousand demonstrators and many well-known New Left political activists. (See \"\"Political Culture\"\" below for more information). From the 1960s through the late 1990s, central areas of New Haven continued to decline both economically and in terms of population despite attempts to resurrect certain neighborhoods through renewal projects. In conjunction with its declining population, New Haven experienced a steep rise in its crime rate.\n[3] Title: \"New Haven, Connecticut\" Text:  In 1970, the New Haven Black Panther trials took place, the largest and longest trials in Connecticut history. Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale and ten other party members were tried for murdering an alleged informant. Beginning on May Day, the city became a center of protest for 12,000 Panther supporters, college students, and New Left activists (including Jean Genet, Benjamin Spock, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and John Froines), who amassed on the New Haven Green, across the street from where the trials were being held.\n[4] Title: \"Malik Rahim\" Text:  In May 1970, after leaving the service, Rahim joined in attempting to organize a chapter of the Black Panther Party for Louisiana. Their first step was the creation of the \"\"National Committee to Combat Fascism,\"\" an organization that became the Black Panther Louisiana chapter. The group set up in a house on Saint Thomas Street, from where it administered its political activities and breakfast, tutoring, and anti-crime programs, but was soon evicted by the owner. The future Panthers moved into a house on Piety Street, near the Desire housing project.\n[5] Title: \"Fred Hampton\" Text:  About the same time that Hampton was successfully organizing young African-Americans for the NAACP, the Black Panther Party (BPP) started rising to national prominence. Hampton was quickly attracted to the Black Panthers' approach, which was based on a ten-point program that integrated black self-determination on the basis of Maoism. Hampton joined the Party and relocated to downtown Chicago, and in November 1968 he joined the Party's nascent Illinois chapter\u2014founded by Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) organizer Bob Brown in late 1967. Over the next year, Hampton and his associates made a number of significant achievements in Chicago.\nQuestion: where did the black panther party take place\nYour answer: ",

Nuclear plants generated 38,247 million kWh at 64.40% PLF in the year 2017-18. India's nuclear power plant development began in 1964. India signed an agreement with General Electric of the United States for the construction and commissioning of two boiling water reactors at Tarapur. In 1967, this effort was placed under India's Department of Atomic Energy. In 1971, India set up its first pressurized heavy water reactors with Canadian collaboration in Rajasthan.\n[2] Title: \"Nuclear Power Corporation of India\" Text:  All nuclear power plants operated by the company are certified for ISO-14001 (Environment Management System).

It has a small fast breeder reactor and is planning a much larger one. It is also developing technology to utilise its abundant resources of thorium as a nuclear fuel. India has 14 small nuclear power reactors in commercial operation, two larger ones under construction, and ten more planned. The 14 operating ones (2548 MWe total) comprise: The two under construction and two of the planned ones are 450 MWe versions of these 200 MWe domestic products.\n[4] Title: \"Electricity sector in India\" Text:  The country plans to implement fast breeder reactors, using plutonium based fuel. Plutonium is obtained by reprocessing spent fuel of first stage reactors. India is in the process of launching its first prototype fast breeder reactor of 500 MW capacity in Tamil Nadu. India has nuclear power plants operating in the following states: Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. These reactors have an installed electricity generation capacity between 100 MW and 540 MW each.

Before the 2009\u201310 season, both the competition and the trophy were known as the 'UEFA Cup'. Before the competition was renamed the UEFA Europa League in the 2009\u201310 season, the UEFA regulations stated that a club could keep the original trophy for a year before returning it to UEFA. After its return, the club could keep a four-fifths scale replica of the original trophy.\n[3] Title: \"UEFA Europa League\" Text:  Upon their third consecutive win or fifth win overall, a club could retain the trophy permanently. However, under the new regulations, the trophy remains in UEFA's keeping at all times. A full-size replica trophy is awarded to each winner of the competition. Also a club that wins three consecutive times or five times overall will receive a multiple-winner badge. As of 2016\u201317, only Sevilla has earned the honour to wear the multiple-winner badge, having achieved both prerequired feats in 2016.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Black Death\" Text:  There appear to have been several introductions into Europe. The plague reached Sicily in October 1347, carried by twelve Genoese galleys, and rapidly spread all over the island. Galleys from Kaffa reached Genoa and Venice in January 1348, but it was the outbreak in Pisa a few weeks later that was the entry point to northern Italy. Towards the end of January, one of the galleys expelled from Italy arrived in Marseille. From Italy, the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France, Spain, Portugal and England by June 1348, then turned and spread east through Germany and Scandinavia from 1348 to 1350.\n[2] Title: \"Black Death\" Text:  Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe via Genoese traders at the port city of Kaffa in the Crimea in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under Jani Beg was suffering from the disease, the army catapulted infected corpses over the city walls of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants. The Genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe, whence it spread north. Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death.\n[3] Title: \"Medieval medicine of Western Europe\" Text:  Eight hundred years after the Plague of Justinian, the bubonic plague returned to Europe. Starting in Asia, the Black Death reached Mediterranean and western Europe in 1348 (possibly from Italian merchants fleeing fighting in Crimea), and killed 25 million Europeans in six years, approximately 1/3 of the total population and up to a 2/3 in the worst-affected urban areas. Before Mongols left besieged Crimean Kaffa the dead or dying bodies of the infected soldiers were loaded onto catapults and launched over Kaffa's walls to infect those inside. This incident was among the earliest known examples of biological warfare and is credited as being the source of the spread of the Black Death into Europe.\n[4] Title: \"History of Western civilization\" Text:  In the Later Middle Ages the Black Plague struck Europe, arriving in 1348. Europe was overwhelmed by the outbreak of bubonic plague, probably brought to Europe by the Mongols. The fleas hosted by rats carried the disease and it devastated Europe. Major cities like Paris, Hamburg, Venice and Florence lost half their population. Around 20 million people \u2013 up to a third of Europe's population \u2013 died from the plague before it receded. The plague periodically returned over coming centuries. The last centuries of the Middle Ages saw the waging of the Hundred Years' War between England and France.\n[5] Title: \"Black Death\" Text:  Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of Marseille around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics. Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom showed the \"\"Y. pestis\"\" genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the Hanseatic cities or another site.\nQuestion: when did the black death get to europe\nYour answer: ",

The battles entailed long fierce fighting; some of the Japanese continued to fight until the official surrender of the Japan on September 2, 1945. The country gained complete independence on July 4, 1946. Initially, the nation's Independence Day holiday (Araw ng Kalayaan) was held on July 4. President Diosdado Macapagal moved it to June 12, the date in 1898 on which Emilio Aguinaldo issued the Philippine Declaration of Independence from Spain.\n[2] Title: \"Commonwealth of the Philippines\" Text:  After the War in the Philippines the Commonwealth was restored and a one-year transitional period in preparation for independence began. Elections followed in April 1946 with Manuel Roxas winning as the first president of the independent Republic of the Philippines and Elpidio Quirino winning as vice-president. In spite of the years of Japanese occupation, the Philippines became independent exactly as scheduled a decade before, on July 4, 1946. The Commonwealth ended when the U.S. recognized Philippine independence on July 4, 1946, as scheduled. However, the economy remained dependent on the U.S.\n[3] Title: \"History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)\" Text:  The Commonwealth of the Philippines was intended to be a transitional government in preparation for the country's full achievement of independence in 1946. After the Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation of the Philippines during World War II, the United States and Philippine Commonwealth military recaptured the Philippines in 1945. According to the terms of the Philippine Independence Act, the United States formally recognised the independence of the Republic of the Philippines on July 4, 1946. The Philippine Revolution began in August 1896 and ended with the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, a ceasefire between the Spanish colonial Governor-General Fernando Primo de Rivera and the revolutionary leader Emilio Aguinaldo which was signed on December 15, 1897.\n[4] Title: \"History of the Philippines\" Text:  The Philippines then became a territory of the United States. U.S forces suppressed a Philippine Revolution led by Emilio Aguinaldo. The United States established the Insular Government to rule the Philippines. In 1907, the elected Philippine Assembly was set up with popular elections. The U.S. promised independence in the Jones Act. The Philippine Commonwealth was established in 1935, as a 10-year interim step prior to full independence. However, in 1942 during World War II, Japan occupied the Philippines. The U.S. military overpowered the Japanese in 1945. The Treaty of Manila in 1946 established an independent Philippine Republic.\n[5] Title: \"Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)\" Text:  The Commonwealth of the Philippines was an insular area that held commonwealth status from November 15, 1935 until July 4, 1946. The United States recognized the future independence of the Philippines in 1934 but called for a transitional ten-year period from 1934 up to 1944. The Second World War disrupted the schedule and the Philippines became fully independent in 1946. Commonwealth (U.S. insular area) In the terminology of the United States insular areas, a Commonwealth is a type of organized but unincorporated dependent territory. There are currently two United States insular areas with the status of commonwealth, the Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico.\nQuestion: when did the philippines become an independent country\nYour answer: ",

An electronic telegram with Keating's report on the meeting was sent to the United States at 16:33 GMT (6:33 pm local time). A message arrived later from United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger saying, \"\"Don't preempt.\"\" At the same time, Kissinger also urged the Soviets to use their influence to prevent war, contacted Egypt with Israel's message of non-preemption, and sent messages to other Arab governments to enlist their help on the side of moderation.\n[4] Title: \"Yom Kippur War\" Text:  Kissinger argued the sending of U.S. aid might cause Israel to moderate its territorial claims, but this thesis raised a protracted debate whether U.S. aid was likely to make it more accommodating or more intransigent toward the Arab world. By October 8, Israel had encountered military difficulties on both fronts.

The single became a success worldwide; it was the ninth-best-selling digital single of 2011 with sales of 8.5 million copies and, , the eighth-best-selling digital single of all time. Levine later credited the song with \"\"totally reviving the band\"\". Since \"\"Moves Like Jagger\"\" was the first time Maroon 5 had collaborated with an outside writer, the band decided to attempt it again on their next album, entitled \"\"Overexposed\"\".\n[2] Title: \"Maroon 5\" Text:  In 2011, the album was re-released and supported by the single \"\"Moves like Jagger\"\", a song featuring American singer Christina Aguilera. The song became the band's second single to reach number one on the Hot 100 chart; it has sold over 14.4 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling singles worldwide. The band released their fourth studio album, \"\"Overexposed\"\", in June 2012. The album peaked at number two on the \"\"Billboard\"\" 200 chart. The first two singles from the album \"\"Payphone\"\" and \"\"One More Night\"\", were both international hits and peaked at two and one on the Hot 100 chart respectively.\n[3] Title: \"Christina Aguilera discography\" Text:  Aguilera's sixth and seventh studio albums, \"\"Bionic\"\" (2010) and \"\"Lotus\"\" (2012), both struggled to match the chart impact and sales of her previous albums. From 2011 to 2013, Aguilera appeared on tracks including \"\"Moves like Jagger\"\", \"\"Feel This Moment\"\" and \"\"Say Something\"\", all of which are top-ten hits worldwide. With \"\"Moves like Jagger\"\" topping the US \"\"Billboard\"\" Hot 100 in 2011, Aguilera became the fourth female artist to top the chart in three consecutive decades (1990s, 2000s, and 2010s).\n[4] Title: \"Christina Aguilera\" Text:  I can only hope that everyone could feel my love for this country and that the true spirit of its anthem still came through\"\". She performed at the opening act of the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, alongside Jennifer Hudson, Martina McBride, Yolanda Adams, and Florence Welch, paying tribute to Aretha Franklin. In April 2011, Aguilera served as a coach on the television series \"\"The Voice\"\" and went on for its three first seasons until December 2012.

The Louvre museum, however, states that the finished pyramid contains 673 glass panes (603 rhombi and 70 triangles). A higher figure was obtained by David A. Shugarts, who reports that the pyramid contains 689 pieces of glass. Shugarts obtained the figure from the Pei's offices. Elementary arithmetic allows for easy counting of the panes: each of the three sides of the pyramid without an entrance has 18 triangular panes and 17 rows of rhombic ones arranged in a triangle, thus giving formula_1 rhombic panes (171 panes total).\n[2] Title: \"Louvre Pyramid\" Text:  The side with the entrance has 11 panes fewer (9 rhombic, 2 triangular), so the whole pyramid consists of formula_2 rhombi and formula_3 triangles, 673 panes total. The myth resurfaced in 2003, when Dan Brown incorporated it in his best-selling novel \"\"The Da Vinci Code\"\", in which the protagonist reflects that \"\"this pyramid, at President Mitterrand's explicit demand, had been constructed of exactly 666 panes of glass \u2014 a bizarre request that had always been a hot topic among conspiracy buffs who claimed 666 was the number of Satan.\"\"\n[3] Title: \"Louvre Pyramid\" Text:  Pei objected, however, and this proposal was eliminated. It has been claimed by some that the glass panes in the Louvre Pyramid number exactly 666, \"\"the number of the beast\"\", often associated with Satan. Dominique Stezepfandt's book \"\"Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Grand Architecte de l'Univers\"\" declares that \"\"the pyramid is dedicated to a power described as the Beast in the Book of Revelation (...) The entire structure is based on the number 6.\"\" The story of the 666 panes originated in the 1980s, when the official brochure published during construction did indeed cite this number (even twice, though a few pages earlier the total number of panes was given as 672 instead).\n[4] Title: \"Louvre Pyramid\" Text:  However, David A. Shugarts reports that according to a spokeswoman of the offices of Pei, the French President never specified the number of panes to be used in the pyramid. Noting how the 666 rumor circulated in some French newspapers in the mid-1980s, she commented: \"\"If you only found those old articles and didn't do any deeper fact checking, and were extremely credulous, you might believe the 666 story.\"\" \"\"La Pyramide Invers\u00e9e\"\" (\"\"The Inverted Pyramid\"\") is a skylight in the Carrousel du Louvre shopping mall in front of the Louvre Museum.\n[5] Title: \"Louvre Pyramid\" Text:  The structure, which was constructed entirely with glass segments and metal poles, reaches a height of .

The pyramid structure was engineered by Nicolet Chartrand Knoll Ltd. of Montreal (Pyramid Structure / Design Consultant) and Rice Francis Ritchie of Paris (Pyramid Structure / Construction Phase).

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Gene Text:  Similarly, some eukaryotic organelles contain a remnant circular chromosome with a small number of genes. Prokaryotes sometimes supplement their chromosome with additional small circles of DNA called plasmids, which usually encode only a few genes and are transferable between individuals. For example, the genes for antibiotic resistance are usually encoded on bacterial plasmids and can be passed between individual cells, even those of different species, via horizontal gene transfer. Whereas the chromosomes of prokaryotes are relatively gene-dense, those of eukaryotes often contain regions of DNA that serve no obvious function.\n[2] Title: DNA Text:  In eukaryotes, DNA is located in the cell nucleus, with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its genotype. A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an open reading frame that can be transcribed, and regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers, which control transcription of the open reading frame.\n[3] Title: Nucleoid Text:  Nucleoid The nucleoid (meaning \"\"nucleus-like\"\") is an irregularly shaped region within the cell of a prokaryote that contains all or most of the genetic material, called genophore. In contrast to the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell, it is not surrounded by a nuclear membrane. The genome of prokaryotic organisms generally is a circular, double-stranded piece of DNA, of which multiple copies may exist at any time. The length of a genome widely varies, but generally is at least a few million base pairs. As in all cellular organisms, length of the DNA molecules of bacterial and archaeal chromosomes is very large compared to the dimensions of the cell, and the genomic DNA molecules must be compacted to fit.\n[4] Title: Biology Text:  The set of chromosomes in a cell and any other hereditary information found in the mitochondria, chloroplasts, or other locations is collectively known as a cell's genome. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is localized in the cell nucleus, or with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its genotype. Homeostasis is the ability of an open system to regulate its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustments that are controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms.\n[5] Title: Life Text:  Cells contain hereditary information that is carried forward as a genetic code during cell division. There are two primary types of cells. Prokaryotes lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, although they have circular DNA and ribosomes. Bacteria and Archaea are two domains of prokaryotes. The other primary type of cells are the eukaryotes, which have distinct nuclei bound by a nuclear membrane and membrane-bound organelles, including mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and vacuoles. In addition, they possess organized chromosomes that store genetic material.\nQuestion: prokaryotic cells may also contain small rings of dna known as\nYour answer: ",

The previous record was 63, originally set by Tom Dempsey (1970) and then matched by Jason Elam (1998), Sebastian Janikowski (2011), David Akers (2012), and Graham Gano (2018).\n[3] Title: \"David Akers\" Text:  Akers made his sixth Pro Bowl at the end of the season. On September 9, 2012, Akers tied the NFL record for the longest field goal by kicking a 63-yard field goal off the crossbar against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. The record was originally set by Tom Dempsey and was shared with Jason Elam and Sebastian Janikowski until Broncos kicker Matt Prater broke the record with a 64-yard field goal on December 8, 2013. The long field goals by Elam, Janikowski, and Prater were all made in Denver, where the ball has the ability to travel slightly farther in thinner air.\n[4] Title: \"Sebastian Janikowski\" Text:  If successful, the kick would have broken the all-time NFL field goal record of 63 yards. However, it bounced off the right upright and came back out. On September 28, 2008, Janikowski unsuccessfully attempted a 76-yard field goal against the San Diego Chargers into the heavy wind right before halftime. This is presumed to be the longest attempt in NFL history; though the league keeps no such records on attempts, the longest known attempts previous to this were 74 yard attempts by Mark Moseley and Joe Danelo in 1979. On October 19, 2008, Janikowski broke his own Raiders team record, making a 57-yard field goal in overtime to defeat the New York Jets, 16\u201313, the longest overtime field goal in NFL history.\n[5] Title: \"History of the Detroit Lions\" Text:  Also in 1970, the Lions were the opponent on the day Tom Dempsey of the New Orleans Saints kicked what was then the longest field goal in NFL history. Dempsey's 63-yard effort on the game's final play lifted the Saints to a 19-17 victory over the Lions. The record was broke in 2013 when then Broncos and current Lions kicker Matt Prater kicked a 64-yard field goal to set the new record. While playing at home against Chicago on October 24, 1971 tragedy struck when wide receiver Chuck Hughes collapsed and died of a massive heart attack.\nQuestion: who has longest field goal in nfl history\nYour answer: ",

In this chart: The \"\"nCr\"\" function on most scientific calculators can be used to calculate hand frequencies; entering with and , for example, yields formula_2 as above. The royal flush is a case of the straight flush. It can be formed 4 ways (one for each suit), giving it a probability of 0.000154% and odds of 649,739 : 1. When ace-low straights and ace-low straight flushes are not counted, the probabilities of each are reduced: straights and straight flushes each become 9/10 as common as they otherwise would be.\n[2] Title: \"Poker probability\" Text:  In some popular variations of poker such as Texas Hold 'Em, a player uses the best five-card poker hand out of seven cards. The frequencies are calculated in a manner similar to that shown for 5-card hands, except additional complications arise due to the extra two cards in the 7-card poker hand. The total number of distinct 7-card hands is formula_3. It is notable that the probability of a no-pair hand is \"\"less\"\" than the probability of a one-pair or two-pair hand. The Ace-high straight flush or royal flush is slightly more frequent (4324) than the lower straight flushes (4140 each) because the remaining two cards can have any value; a King-high straight flush, for example, cannot have the Ace of its suit in the hand (as that would make it ace-high instead).\n[3] Title: \"Slot machine\" Text:  There was no direct payout mechanism, so a pair of kings might get the player a free beer, whereas a royal flush could pay out cigars or drinks, the prizes wholly dependent on what was on offer at the local establishment. To make the odds better for the house, two cards were typically removed from the deck: the ten of spades and the jack of hearts, which doubles the odds against winning a royal flush. The drums could also be rearranged to further reduce a player's chance of winning. Due to the vast number of possible wins with the original poker card-based game, it proved practically impossible to come up with a way to make a machine capable of making an automatic payout for all possible winning combinations.\n[4] Title: \"Royal Flush (game)\" Text:  First, the deck is dealt into five piles: two piles of eleven cards and three piles of ten. The player first turns the first pile up and looks for either an ace, a ten, a king, a queen, and a jack, cards which comprise a royal flush. Once such a card is found, the search ends there, with the cards on top of it discarded and those under it left alone. The search then proceeds into the next pile and the search for other cards in the royal flush continues.\n[5] Title: \"Royal Flush (game)\" Text:  Also, the suit of the first card found determines the suit of the entire royal flush. When a pile contains no card of the royal flush being searched, the entire pile is discarded. When another royal-flush card is found in a pile, the search continues until all five piles are searched and royal-flush cards are at the top of their piles. Afterwards, the piles are placed on top of each other in the reverse direction of the deal. So if the deal is from left to right, once the search ends, each pile is placed on its neighbor to the left.\nQuestion: what are the odds of getting a royal flush in poker\nYour answer: ",

He is a senior officer in the British Secret Intelligence Service who serves as a Soviet mole. The novel follows aging spymaster George Smiley's endeavours to uncover the mole. The character is partly modelled after the real-life double agent Kim Philby, part of the notorious Cambridge Five spy ring in Britain, who defected to the USSR in 1963. Haydon was born around 1917; no specific year is given but he is known to have been an undergraduate at Oxford University in 1937.\n[2] Title: \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" Text:  Tarr is sent to Paris where he passes a coded message to Alleline about \"\"information crucial to the well-being of the Service\"\". This triggers an emergency meeting between Gerald and Polyakov at the safe house where Smiley and Guillam are lying in wait. Haydon is revealed to be the mole. Haydon's interrogation reveals that he had been recruited several decades ago by Karla and became a full-fledged Soviet spy partly for political reasons, partly in frustration at Britain's rapidly declining influence on the world stage. He is expected to be exchanged with the Soviet Union for several of the agents he betrayed, but is killed shortly before he is due to leave England.\n[3] Title: \"George Smiley\" Text:  Guillam remains in the Circus as Smiley's sole resource/ally, albeit in a greatly diminished position. In September or October 1973, the events of \"\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\"\" take place, with Smiley successfully managing to expose Haydon as the long-term Soviet agent, or \"\"mole\"\", codenamed \"\"Gerald\"\" and reporting directly to Smiley's nemesis, Karla, head of Moscow Centre. Following the revelation, Alleline is drummed out of the Circus for his failure to identify Haydon himself and for permitting such a breach of national security to occur on his watch.\n[4] Title: \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" Text:  Smiley believes the mole Gerald must be one of these four: Alleline himself, Roy Bland, Toby Esterhase, or Bill Haydon. By examining classified documents surreptitiously provided by Lacon and Guillam, Smiley discovers that the operation has a secret London end: a safe house where Alleline and his inner circle personally collect information from a Merlin emissary posted in London under diplomatic cover. Eventually, Smiley realises that the emissary must be Polyakov himself, and that the actual flow of information goes the other way, with Gerald passing actual British secrets (\"\"gold dust\"\") while receiving fake and worthless Soviet material (\"\"chicken feed\"\").\n[5] Title: \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" Text:  Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Anthony Blunt, John Cairncross, and Kim Philby, later known as the Cambridge Five, had been exposed as KGB moles. The five had risen to very senior positions in branches of the British government. The book, based on the premise of uncovering a Soviet double agent in the SIS, offers a novelisation of this period. It is also set against the larger theme of the decline of British influence on the world stage after World War II, with the USA and the USSR emerging as the dominant superpowers leading into the period of the Cold War.\nQuestion: who was the double agent in tinker tailor soldier spy\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Mitosis Text:  This motor activity, coupled with polymerisation and depolymerisation of microtubules, provides the pulling force necessary to later separate the chromosome's two chromatids. After the microtubules have located and attached to the kinetochores in prometaphase, the two centrosomes begin pulling the chromosomes towards opposite ends of the cell. The resulting tension causes the chromosomes to align along the \"\"metaphase plate\"\" or \"\"equatorial plane\"\", an imaginary line that is centrally located between the two centrosomes (at approximately the midline of the cell). To ensure equitable distribution of chromosomes at the end of mitosis, the \"\"metaphase checkpoint\"\" guarantees that kinetochores are properly attached to the mitotic spindle and that the chromosomes are aligned along the metaphase plate.\n[2] Title: Metaphase Text:  Metaphase Metaphase (from the Greek \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac, \"\"adjacent\"\" and \u03c6\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, \"\"stage\"\") is a stage of mitosis in the eukaryotic cell cycle in which chromosomes are at their second-most condensed and coiled stage (they are at their most condensed in anaphase). These chromosomes, carrying genetic information, align in the equator of the cell before being separated into each of the two daughter cells. Metaphase accounts for approximately 4% of the cell cycle's duration. Preceded by events in prometaphase and followed by anaphase, microtubules formed in prophase have already found and attached themselves to kinetochores in metaphase.\n[3] Title: Metaphase Text:  Metaphase Metaphase (from the Greek \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac, \"\"adjacent\"\" and \u03c6\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, \"\"stage\"\") is a stage of mitosis in the eukaryotic cell cycle in which chromosomes are at their second-most condensed and coiled stage (they are at their most condensed in anaphase).

This even alignment is due to the counterbalance of the pulling powers generated by the opposing kinetochore microtubules, analogous to a tug-of-war between two people of equal strength, ending with the destruction of B cyclin. In certain types of cells, chromosomes do not line up at the metaphase plate and instead move back and forth between the poles randomly, only roughly lining up along the middleline.\n[5] Title: \"Cleavage furrow\" Text:  Mitosis includes four phases, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Prophase is the initial phase when spindle fibers appear that function to move the chromosomes toward opposite poles. This spindle apparatus consists of microtubules, microfilaments and a complex network of various proteins. During metaphase, the chromosomes line up using the spindle apparatus in the middle of the cell along the equatorial plate. The chromosomes move to opposite poles during anaphase and remain attached to the spindle fibers by their centromeres. Animal cell cleavage furrow formation is caused by a ring of actin microfilaments called the contractile ring, which forms during early anaphase.\nQuestion: part of mitosis wherein the chromosomes align at the equator\nYour answer: ",

But Buffier did not claim for these truths of common sense the absolute certainty which characterizes the knowledge we have of our own existence or the logical deductions we make from our thoughts; they possess merely the highest probability, and the man who rejects them is to be considered a fool, though he is not guilty of a contradiction.\n[2] Title: \"Thomas Paine\" Text:  Paine also used a notion of \"\"common sense\"\" favored by philosophes in the Continental Enlightenment. They held that common sense could refute the claims of traditional institutions. Thus, Paine used \"\"common sense\"\" as a weapon to delegitimize the monarchy and overturn prevailing conventional wisdom. Rosenfeld concludes that the phenomenal appeal of his pamphlet resulted from his synthesis of popular and elite elements in the independence movement. According to historian Robert Middlekauff, \"\"Common Sense\"\" became immensely popular mainly because Paine appealed to widespread convictions.\n[3] Title: \"Common Sense (pamphlet)\" Text:  Common Sense (pamphlet) Common Sense was a pamphlet written by Thomas Paine in 1775\u201376 advocating independence from Great Britain to people in the Thirteen Colonies. Written in clear and persuasive prose, Paine marshaled moral and political arguments to encourage common people in the Colonies to fight for egalitarian government. It was published anonymously on January 10, 1776, at the beginning of the American Revolution, and became an immediate sensation. It was sold and distributed widely and read aloud at taverns and meeting places. In proportion to the population of the colonies at that time (2.5 million), it had the largest sale and circulation of any book published in American history.\n[4] Title: \"Common Sense (pamphlet)\" Text:  Each of these arguments is in some way true, and together they portray \"\"Common Sense\"\" as an impressive piece of propaganda advocating a distinct and timely action and set of principles. Coupling this with the immense publicity and readership created by both the publishing dispute and the newspaper debates establishes \"\"Common Sense\"\" as an important stepping stone towards independence. Common Sense (pamphlet) Common Sense was a pamphlet written by Thomas Paine in 1775\u201376 advocating independence from Great Britain to people in the Thirteen Colonies. Written in clear and persuasive prose, Paine marshaled moral and political arguments to encourage common people in the Colonies to fight for egalitarian government.\n[5] Title: \"Common Sense (pamphlet)\" Text:  As of 2006, it remains the all-time best selling American title, and is still in print today. \"\"Common Sense\"\" made public a persuasive and impassioned case for independence, which before the pamphlet had not yet been given serious intellectual consideration. Paine connected independence with common dissenting Protestant beliefs as a means to present a distinctly American political identity, structuring \"\"Common Sense\"\" as if it were a sermon. Historian Gordon S. Wood described \"\"Common Sense\"\" as \"\"the most incendiary and popular pamphlet of the entire revolutionary era\"\".\nQuestion: where did the term common sense come from\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Optical microscope\" Text:  There are two basic types of optical microscopes: simple microscopes and compound microscopes. A simple microscope is one which uses a single lens for magnification, such as a magnifying glass. A compound microscope uses several lenses to enhance the magnification of an object. The vast majority of modern research microscopes are compound microscopes while some cheaper commercial digital microscopes are simple single lens microscopes. Compound microscopes can be further divided into a variety of other types of microscopes which differ in their optical configurations, cost, and intended purposes. A regular microscope uses a lens or set of lenses to enlarge an object through angular magnification alone, giving the viewer an erect enlarged virtual image.\n[2] Title: Microscopy Text:  Optical or light microscopy involves passing visible light transmitted through or reflected from the sample through a single lens or multiple lenses to allow a magnified view of the sample. The resulting image can be detected directly by the eye, imaged on a photographic plate, or captured digitally. The single lens with its attachments, or the system of lenses and imaging equipment, along with the appropriate lighting equipment, sample stage, and support, makes up the basic light microscope. The most recent development is the digital microscope, which uses a CCD camera to focus on the exhibit of interest.\n[3] Title: \"Optical microscope\" Text:  Optical microscope The optical microscope, often referred to as the light microscope, is a type of microscope that commonly uses visible light and a system of lenses to magnify images of small objects. Optical microscopes are the oldest design of microscope and were possibly invented in their present compound form in the 17th century. Basic optical microscopes can be very simple, although many complex designs aim to improve resolution and sample contrast. Often used in the classroom and at home unlike the electron microscope which is used for closer viewing. The image from an optical microscope can be captured by normal, photosensitive cameras to generate a micrograph.\n[4] Title: Microscope Text:  The most common type of microscope (and the first invented) is the optical microscope. This is an optical instrument containing one or more lenses producing an enlarged image of a sample placed in the focal plane. Optical microscopes have refractive glass (occasionally plastic or quartz), to focus light on the eye or on to another light detector. Mirror-based optical microscopes operate in the same manner. Typical magnification of a light microscope, assuming visible range light, is up to 1250x with a theoretical resolution limit of around 0.250 micrometres or 250 nanometres.\n[5] Title: \"Optical microscope\" Text:  Optical microscope The optical microscope, often referred to as the light microscope, is a type of microscope that commonly uses visible light and\nQuestion: what are two different types of light microscopes\nYour answer: ",

Through an acting career that spanned nearly six decades, Wray attained international recognition as an actress in horror films. She has been dubbed one of the first \"\"scream queens\"\". After appearing in minor film roles, Wray gained media attention after being selected as one of the \"\"WAMPAS Baby Stars\"\" in 1926.\n[2] Title: \"Fay Wray\" Text:  \"\"The Most Dangerous Game\"\" was followed by Wray's most memorable film, \"\"King Kong\"\". According to Wray, Jean Harlow had been RKO's original choice, but because MGM put Harlow under exclusive contract during the pre-production phase of the film, she became unavailable and Wray was approached by director Merian C. Cooper to play the role of Ann Darrow, the blonde captive of King Kong. Wray was paid $10,000 ($ in dollars) to play the role. The film was a commercial success.\n[3] Title: \"Jean Harlow\" Text:  According to Fay Wray, who played Ann Darrow in \"\"King Kong\"\" (1933) for Radio Pictures, Harlow was the original choice to play the screaming blonde heroine. As MGM had put Harlow under exclusive contract during the pre-production phase of the film, she became unavailable for \"\"Kong\"\", and the part went to the brunette Wray, wearing a blonde wig. When mobster Bugsy Siegel came to Hollywood to expand casino operations, Harlow became the godmother of Siegel's eldest daughter, Millicent. Paul Bern was now romantically involved with Harlow and spoke to Louis B. Mayer about buying out her contract with Hughes and signing her to MGM, but Mayer declined.\n[4] Title: \"Naomi Watts\" Text:  Watts then starred in the 2005 remake of \"\"King Kong\"\" as Ann Darrow. Watts was the first choice for the role, portrayed by Fay Wray in the original film, with no other actors considered. In preparation for her role, Watts met with Wray, who was to make a cameo appearance and say the final line of dialogue, but she died during pre-production at the age of 96. \"\"King Kong\"\" proved to be Watts' most commercially successful film yet. Helmed by \"\"The Lord of the Rings\"\" director Peter Jackson, the film won high praise and grossed US$550 million worldwide (equivalent to US$ million in ).\n[5] Title: \"King Kong (2005 film)\" Text:  Frequent Jackson collaborator Howard Shore makes a cameo appearance as the conductor of the New York theater from where Kong escapes. Watts, Black, and Brody were the first choices for their respective roles with no other actors considered. In preparation for her role, Watts met with the original Ann Darrow, Fay Wray. Jackson wanted Wray to make a cameo appearance and say the final line of dialogue, but she died during pre-production at 96 years old.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Beta particle\" Text:  Beta particle A beta particle, also called beta ray or beta radiation (symbol \u03b2), is a high-energy, high-speed electron or positron emitted by the radioactive decay of an atomic nucleus during the process of beta decay. There are two forms of beta decay, \u03b2 decay and \u03b2 decay, which produce electrons and positrons respectively. Beta particles with an energy of 0.5 MeV have a range of about one metre in air; the distance is dependent on the particle energy. Beta particles are a type of ionizing radiation and for radiation protection purposes are regarded as being less ionising than alpha particles, but more ionising than gamma rays.\n[2] Title: \"Ionizing radiation\" Text:  However, this type of radiation is significantly attenuated by the Earth's atmosphere, which is a radiation shield equivalent to about 10 meters of water. Beta particles are high-energy, high-speed electrons or positrons emitted by certain types of radioactive nuclei, such as potassium-40. The production of beta particles is termed beta decay. They are designated by the Greek letter beta (\u03b2). There are two forms of beta decay, \u03b2 and \u03b2, which respectively give rise to the electron and the positron. When something is said to have radioactive contamination, it often means that there are beta particles being emitted from its surface, detectable with a Geiger counter or other radiation detector.\n[3] Title: \"Beta decay\" Text:  Beta decay In nuclear physics, beta decay (\"\"\u03b2\"\"-decay) is a type of radioactive decay in which a beta ray (fast energetic electron or positron) and a neutrino are emitted from an atomic nucleus. For example, beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron, or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron (positron emission), thus changing the nuclide type. Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay, but are created in the decay process.\n[4] Title: \"Beta particle\" Text:  The virtual W boson then decays into an electron and an antineutrino. \u03b2\u2212 decay commonly occurs among the neutron-rich fission byproducts produced in nuclear reactors. Free neutrons also decay via this process. Both of these processes contribute to the copious quantities of beta rays and electron antineutrinos produced by fission-reactor fuel rods. Unstable atomic nuclei with an excess of protons may undergo \u03b2 decay, also called positron decay, where a proton is converted into a neutron, a positron, and an electron neutrino: Beta-plus decay can only happen inside nuclei when the absolute value of the binding energy of the daughter nucleus is greater than that of the parent nucleus, i.e., the daughter nucleus is a lower-energy state.\n[5] Title: \"Beta particle\" Text:  The accompanying decay scheme diagram shows the beta decay of Cs-137. CS-137 is noted for a characteristic gamma peak at 661 KeV, but this is actually emitted by the daughter radionuclide Ba-137m. The diagram shows the type and energy of the emitted radiation, its relative abundance, and the daughter nuclides after decay. Phosphorus-32 is a beta emitter widely used in medicine and has a short half-life of 14.29 days and decays into sulfur-32 by beta decay as shown in this nuclear equation: 1.709 MeV of energy is released during the decay. The kinetic energy of the electron varies with an average of approximately 0.5 MeV and the remainder of the energy is carried by the nearly undetectable electron antineutrino.\nQuestion: what is the nuclear symbol for a beta particle\nYour answer: ",

On a Macintosh, the Alt key is called the Option key. It is not used to enter numeric character codes. Instead, keyboard letters and numbers are used. The diagram below shows the special characters a US Mac keyboard will produce when the Option key is pressed. The highlighted orange keys show the accents available from the combination of the key and the keyboard characters (on the top letters row) and (on the bottom letters row). The accent then can be applied to associated letters both lower and uppercase.\n[2] Title: \"Option key\" Text:  (See command key for information about the history and the \"\"open apple\"\".) Since the 1990s, \"\"alt\"\" typically appears on the key, as well, for use as an Alt key with non-Mac software, such as Unix and Windows programs. However, the Option key in a Mac operating system functions differently from the Alt key under other Unix-like systems or Microsoft Windows. Most notably, it is not used to access menus or hotkeys, but is instead used as a modifier for other command codes, and also to provide easier access to various accents and symbols.\n[3] Title: \"Alt key\" Text:  However, in modern software, due to the requirement of the high bit for internationalization, Alt no longer works in such a way. Since the 1990s Alt has been printed on the Option key () on most Mac keyboards. Alt is used in non-Mac software, such as non-macOS Unix and Windows programs, but in macOS it is always referred as the Option key. The Option key's behaviour in macOS differs slightly from that of the Windows Alt key (it is used as a modifier rather than to access pull-down menus, for example).\n[4] Title: \"Alt key\" Text:  The additional characters a Mac will produce are a combination of both the key and the key pressed down together. With this combination pressed the keyboard will now produce a different set or an uppercase version of the previous set in some cases.

The two provinces were the lands of the \"\"daimy\u014ds\"\" that submitted to Ieyasu after the Battle of Sekigahara (1600).

When a magnet moves in relation to an electromagnetic coil, this changes the magnetic flux passing through the coil, and thus induces the flow of an electric current, which can be used to do work. A linear alternator is most commonly used to convert back-and-forth motion directly into electrical energy. This short-cut eliminates the need for a crank or linkage that would otherwise be required to convert a reciprocating motion to a rotary motion in order to be compatible with a rotary generator. The simplest type of linear alternator is the Faraday flashlight.\n[2] Title: \"Linear actuator\" Text:  Since the motor moves in a linear fashion, no lead screw is needed to convert rotary motion to linear. While high capacity is possible, the material and/or motor limitations on most designs are surpassed relatively quickly due to a reliance solely on magnetic attraction and repulsion forces. Most linear motors have a low load capacity compared to other types of linear actuators. Linear motors have an advantage in outdoor or dirty environments in that the two halves do not need to contact each other, and so the electromagnetic drive coils can be waterproofed and sealed against moisture and corrosion, allowing for a very long service life.\n[3] Title: \"Linear actuator\" Text:  Linear actuator A linear actuator is an actuator that creates motion in a straight line, in contrast to the circular motion of a conventional electric motor. Linear actuators are used in machine tools and industrial machinery, in computer peripherals such as disk drives and printers, in valves and dampers, and in many other places where linear motion is required. Hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders inherently produce linear motion. Many other mechanisms are used to generate linear motion from a rotating motor. Mechanical linear actuators typically operate by conversion of rotary motion into linear motion.\n[4] Title: \"Linear actuator\" Text:  Conversion is commonly made via a few simple types of mechanism: Some mechanical linear actuators only pull, such as hoists, chain drive and belt drives. Others only push (such as a cam actuator). Pneumatic and hydraulic cylinders, or lead screws can be designed to generate force in both directions. Mechanical actuators typically convert rotary motion of a control knob or handle into linear displacement via screws and/or gears to which the knob or handle is attached. A jackscrew or car jack is a familiar mechanical actuator. Another family of actuators are based on the segmented spindle.\n[5] Title: \"Linear actuator\" Text:  As the temperature of the TCP actuator increases by Joule heating, the polymer contracts and it causes the actuator contraction . Electro-mechanical actuators are similar to mechanical actuators except that the control knob or handle is replaced with an electric motor. Rotary motion of the motor is converted to linear displacement. There are many designs of modern linear actuators and every company that manufactures them tends to have a proprietary method. The following is a generalized description of a very simple electro-mechanical linear actuator. Typically, an electric motor is mechanically connected to rotate a lead screw.\nQuestion: how to change linear motion to rotary motion\nYour answer: ",

The organization was established in July, 1830 by John Doherty, after an apparently unsuccessful attempt to create a similar national presence with the National Union of Cotton-spinners. Doherty was the first secretary, and the Association quickly enrolled approximately 150 unions. These consisted mostly of textile related unions, but also included mechanics, blacksmiths, and various others. Within the first nine months, Webb estimates that membership was between 10,000 and 20,000 individuals spread across the five counties of Lancashire, Cheshire, Derby, Nottingham, and Leicester.\n[2] Title: \"United Kingdom Alliance of Organised Trades\" Text:  United Kingdom Alliance of Organised Trades The UK Association of Organised Trades was founded in Sheffield in July 1866. It was an important forerunner to the Trades Union Congress. The organisation was largely inspired by William Dronfield, who was elected as its Secretary. It initially represented over 200,000 trade unionists, organised through trades councils or national unions. Among the attendees at the first conference were the London Working Men's Association, and George Odger of the London Trades Council. The organisation agreed to secure mutual co-operation during lock-outs, to oppose the Master and Servant Act, and to work for the establishment of Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration.\n[3] Title: \"Trade union\" Text:  The latter name was to hide the organization's real purpose in a time when trade unions were still illegal. The first attempts at setting up a national general union were made in the 1820s and 30s. The National Association for the Protection of Labour was established in 1830 by John Doherty, after an apparently unsuccessful attempt to create a similar national presence with the National Union of Cotton-spinners. The Association quickly enrolled approximately 150 unions, consisting mostly of textile related unions, but also including mechanics, blacksmiths, and various others.

A woman could piss it out\"\", and left. After the City had been destroyed, Samuel Pepys looked back on the events and wrote in his diary on 7 September 1666: \"\"People do all the world over cry out of the simplicity [the stupidity] of my Lord Mayor in general; and more particularly in this business of the fire, laying it all upon him.\"\"\n[2] Title: \"Great Fire of London\" Text:  Pepys was a senior official in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had turned it into a conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the riverfront. The houses on London Bridge were burning. He took a boat to inspect the destruction around Pudding Lane at close range and describes a \"\"lamentable\"\" fire, \"\"everybody endeavouring to remove their goods, and flinging into the river or bringing them into lighters that lay off; poor people staying in their houses as long as till the very fire touched them, and then running into boats, or clambering from one pair of stairs by the water-side to another.\"\"\n[3] Title: \"Great Fire of London\" Text:  Pepys comments in his diary that nobody was trying to put it out, but instead they fled from it in fear, hurrying \"\"to remove their goods, and leave all to the fire.\"\" The flames crept towards the river front with little interference from the overwhelmed community and soon torched the flammable warehouses along the wharves. The resulting conflagration cut off the firefighters from the immediate water supply from the river and set alight the water wheels under London Bridge which pumped water to the Cornhill water tower; the direct access to the river and the supply of piped water failed together.\n[4] Title: \"Great Fire of London\" Text:  The piped water had already failed which they were designed to use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached. Gangs of men tried desperately to manoeuvre the engines right up to the river to fill their reservoirs, and several of the engines toppled into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane. The personal experiences of many Londoners during the fire are glimpsed in letters and memoirs. The two best-known diarists of the Restoration are Samuel Pepys (1633\u20131703) and John Evelyn (1620\u20131706), and both recorded the events and their own reactions day by day, and made great efforts to keep themselves informed of what was happening all over the City and beyond.\n[5] Title: \"Samuel Pepys\" Text:  In particular, it is an invaluable source for the study of the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665\u20137, the Great Plague of 1665, and the Great Fire of London in 1666.

Rowling\" Text:  Rowling, her publishers, and Time Warner, the owner of the rights to the \"\"Harry Potter\"\" films, have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyright. The worldwide popularity of the \"\"Harry Potter\"\" series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them. Another area of legal dispute involves a series of injunctions obtained by Rowling and her publishers to prohibit anyone from reading her books before their official release date.\n[2] Title: \"Harry Potter (film series)\" Text:  Highly impressed by Rowling's work, he began the process that led to one of the most successful cinematic franchises of all time. Heyman's enthusiasm led to Rowling's 1999 sale of the film rights for the first four \"\"Harry Potter\"\" books to Warner Bros. for a reported \u00a31 million (US$2,000,000). A demand Rowling made was that the principal cast be kept strictly British, allowing nevertheless for the inclusion of many Irish actors, such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in \"\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\"\" where characters from the book are specified as such.\n[3] Title: \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)\" Text:  His staff at Heyday Films then suggested \"\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\"\", which his assistant believed was \"\"a cool idea.\"\" Heyman pitched the idea to Warner Bros. and in 1999, Rowling sold the company the rights to the first four \"\"Harry Potter\"\" books for a reported \u00a31 million (US$1,982,900). A demand Rowling made was that the principal cast be kept strictly British, nonetheless allowing for the inclusion of Irish actors such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in \"\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\"\" where characters from the book are specified as such.\n[4] Title: \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" Text:  In 1999, Rowling sold the film rights of the first four \"\"Harry Potter\"\" books to Warner Bros. for a reported \u00a31 million ($1.65 million in 1999). Rowling demanded that the principal cast be kept strictly British but allowed for the casting of Irish actors such as the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore and of foreign actors as characters of the same nationalities in later books. After extensive casting, filming began in September 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios and in London, with production ending in July 2001. \"\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\"\" was released in London on 14 November 2001.\n[5] Title: \"Harry Potter (film series)\" Text:  The Dark Lord discovers Harry's hunt for Horcruxes and launches an attack on Hogwarts School, where the trio return for one last stand against the dark forces that threaten the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. The rights for the first four novels in the series were sold to Warner Bros. for \u00a31,000,000 by J.K. Rowling. After the release of the fourth book in July 2000, the first film, \"\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\"\", was released on 16 November 2001.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Colonial India\" Text:  According to Olson, several reasons may have triggered the Rebellion. For example, Olson concludes that the East India Company's attempt to annexe and expand its direct control of India, by arbitrary laws such as Doctrine of Lapse, combined with employment discrimination against Indians, contributed to the 1857 Rebellion. The East India Company officers lived like princes, the company finances were in shambles, and the company's effectiveness in India was examined by the British crown after 1858. As a result, the East India Company lost its powers of government and British India formally came under direct British rule, with an appointed Governor-General of India.\n[2] Title: \"Doctrine of lapse\" Text:  Following the rebellion, in 1858, the new British Viceroy of India, whose rule replaced that of the British East India Company, renounced the doctrine. The princely state of Kittur was taken over by the East India Company in 1824 by imposing a 'doctrine of lapse'. So it is debatable whether it was devised by Lord Dalhousie in 1848, though he arguably made it official by documenting it. Dalhousie's annexations and the doctrine of lapse had caused suspicion and uneasiness among most ruling princes in India. Dalhousie applied the doctrine of lapse vigorously for annexing Indian princely states, but the policy was not solely his invention.\n[3] Title: \"Doctrine of lapse\" Text:  Doctrine of lapse The doctrine of lapse was an annexation policy applied by the British East India Company in India until 1858. According to the doctrine, any Indian princely state under the suzerainty of the British East India Company (the dominant imperial power in the subcontinent), as a vassal state under the British subsidiary system, would have its princely status abolished (and therefore annexed into British India) if the ruler was either \"\"manifestly incompetent or died without a male heir\"\". The latter supplanted the long-established right of an Indian sovereign without an heir to choose a successor.\n[4] Title: \"Doctrine of lapse\" Text:  The Court of Directors of the East India Company had articulated this early in 1834. As per this policy, the Company annexed Mandvi in 1839, Kolaba and Jalaun in 1840 and Surat in 1842. Doctrine of lapse The doctrine of lapse was an annexation policy applied by the British East India Company in India until 1858. According to the doctrine, any Indian princely state under the suzerainty of the British East India Company (the dominant imperial power in the subcontinent), as a vassal state under the British subsidiary system, would have its princely status abolished (and therefore annexed into British India) if the ruler was either \"\"manifestly incompetent or died without a male heir\"\".\n[5] Title: \"Princely state\" Text:  A controversial aspect of East India Company rule was the doctrine of lapse, a policy under which lands whose feudal ruler died (or otherwise became unfit to rule) without a male biological heir (as opposed to an adopted son) would become directly controlled by the Company and an adopted son would not become the ruler of the princely state. This policy went counter to Indian tradition where, unlike Europe, it was far more the accepted norm for a ruler to appoint his own heir. The doctrine of lapse was pursued most vigorously by the Governor-General Sir James Ramsay, 10th Earl (later 1st Marquess) of Dalhousie.\nQuestion: doctrine of lapse was of the cause for which rebellion\nYour answer: ",

In 2007, the pressure from France's League for Protection of Birds and from the European Union resulted in the French government promising to enforce the EU directive protecting the ortolan. After several years of active citizen watch revealing little if any change in the field situation, the local representative of the government repeated this statement in 2016. European Union member states prohibit: Ortolan bunting The ortolan (\"\"Emberiza hortulana\"\") or ortolan bunting, is a bird in the bunting family Emberizidae, a passerine family now separated by most modern scholars from the finches, Fringillidae.\n[2] Title: \"Ortolan bunting\" Text:  Traditionally diners cover their heads with their napkin, or a towel while eating the delicacy. The bird is so widely used that its French populations dropped dangerously low, leading to laws restricting its use in 1999. In September 2007, the French government announced its intent to enforce long ignored laws protecting the bird. It was famously eaten as the last New Year's Eve meal of former French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand before he died in early 1996. The ortolan is in length and weighs . In appearance and habits it much resembles its relative the yellowhammer, but lacks the bright colouring of that species; the ortolan's head, for instance, is greenish-grey, instead of a bright yellow.\n[3] Title: Cockfight Text:  However, secular cockfighting remains widely popular in Bali, despite its illegal status. Cockfighting, and the possession of cockfighting equipment, is illegal in Australia. Holding cockfights is a crime in France, but there is an exemption under subparagraph 3 of article 521\u20131 of the French penal code for cockfights and bullfights in locales where an uninterrupted tradition exists for them. Thus, cockfighting is allowed in the Nord-Pas de Calais region, where it takes place in a small number of towns including Raimbeaucourt, La Bistade and other villages around Lille.\n[4] Title: \"French cuisine\" Text:  Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate the success of the hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities. With the advent of deep-freeze and the air-conditioned \"\"hypermarch\u00e9\"\", these seasonal variations are less marked than hitherto, but they are still observed, in some cases due to legal restrictions. Crayfish, for example, have a short season and it is illegal to catch them out of season. Moreover, they do not freeze well.\n[5] Title: \"Foie gras\" Text:  A similar study on Muscovy ducks found that gavage feeding was related to an increase in panting behaviour and serum corticosterone levels, indicating increased stress attributable to this feeding method. In France, at the end of 2015, individual cages were prohibited to improve animal welfare. They will be replaced by cages which house 4 to 5 birds. During the force-feeding period, the birds are kept in individual cages, with wire or plastic mesh floors, or sometimes in small groups on slatted floors. Individual caging restricts movements and behaviours by preventing the birds from standing erect, turning around, or flapping their wings.\nQuestion: bird that is illegal to eat in france\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Book of Genesis\" Text:  Book of Genesis The Book of Genesis (from the Latin Vulgate, in turn borrowed or transliterated from Greek \"\"\"\", meaning \"\"Origin\"\"; , \"\"\"\"B\u0259r\u0113\u0161\u012b\u1e6f\"\"\"\", \"\"In [the] beginning\"\") is the first book of the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh) and the Old Testament. It can be divided into two parts, the Primeval history (chapters 1\u201311) and the Ancestral history (chapters 12\u201350). The primeval history sets out the author's (or authors') concepts of the nature of the deity and of humankind's relationship with its maker: God creates a world which is good and fit for mankind, but when man corrupts it with sin God decides to destroy his creation, saving only the righteous Noah to reestablish the relationship between man and God.\n[2] Title: \"Documentary hypothesis\" Text:  There is a growing recognition that Genesis developed apart from the Exodus stories until joined to it by the Priestly writer. The Torah (or Pentateuch) is the collective name for the first five books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. According to tradition they were dictated by God to Moses, but when modern critical scholarship began to be applied to the Bible it was discovered that the Pentateuch was not the unified text one would expect from a single author. As a result, the Mosaic authorship of the Torah had been largely rejected by leading scholars by the 17th century, and the modern consensus is that it is the product of a long evolutionary process.\n[3] Title: \"Old Testament\" Text:  The first five books \u2013 Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, book of Numbers and Deuteronomy \u2013 reached their present form in the Persian period (538\u2013332 BC), and their authors were the elite of exilic returnees who controlled the Temple at that time. The books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings follow, forming a history of Israel from the Conquest of Canaan to the Siege of Jerusalem c. 587 BC. There is a broad consensus among scholars that these originated as a single work (the so-called \"\"Deuteronomistic history\"\") during the Babylonian exile of the 6th century BC.\n[4] Title: Torah Text:  8:8, 18; 10:29\u201330; cf. 9:3). Christian scholars usually refer to the first five books of the Hebrew Bible as the \"\"Pentateuch\"\" (, \"\"pent\u00e1teuchos\"\", \"\"five scrolls\"\"), a term first used in the Hellenistic Judaism of Alexandria. The Torah starts from the beginning of God's creating the world, through the beginnings of the people of Israel, their descent into Egypt, and the giving of the Torah at biblical Mount Sinai. It ends with the death of Moses, just before the people of Israel cross to the promised land of Canaan.\n[5] Title: Heptateuch Text:  Heptateuch The Heptateuch (seven containers) is a name sometimes given to the first seven books of the Hebrew Bible. The seven books are Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua and Judges. The first four of these are sometimes called the Tetrateuch, the first five are commonly known as the Torah or the Pentateuch, the first six as the Hexateuch. With the addition of the Book of Ruth, it becomes the Octateuch. The \"\"Enneateuch\"\" is the Heptateuch plus the Books of Samuel and the Books of Kings (each pair of books counted as one, and not including the Book of Ruth).\nQuestion: what is the first book in the bible\nYour answer: ",

The rule allowed players who signed professional contracts prior to June 1, 1979 who were already not wearing helmets to continue to do so for the rest of their careers provided a liability waiver was signed, if they so desired. The last player to play without a helmet was Craig MacTavish, who played his final game during the 1996\u201397 season for the St. Louis Blues.\n[2] Title: \"National Hockey League rules\" Text:  In a later game, he suffered a skull fracture which cost him most of the sight in his other eye. In August 1979, John Ziegler Jr., the president of the National Hockey League, announced that protective helmets would become mandatory in the NHL. \"\"The introduction of the helmet rule will be an additional safety factor\"\", he said. The only exception to the rule are players\u2014after signing a waiver form\u2014who signed pro contracts prior to June 1, 1979. Essentially, this grandfather clause allowed hockey's veterans to choose whether or not they wanted to wear helmets but forced all new players to wear them.\n[3] Title: \"1979\u201380 NHL season\" Text:  Hartford (14th overall) and Edmonton (16th overall) qualified for the playoffs, but both teams were swept 3 games to 0 in their respective first-round playoff series. In August 1979, John Ziegler, the NHL president, announced that protective helmets will be mandatory for all NHL players. \"\"The introduction of the helmet rule will be an additional safety factor\"\", he said. The only exception will be for players who signed their pro contracts prior to June 1, 1979. Those players under the exception who chose not to wear a helmet also had to sign a waiver form.\n[4] Title: \"John Ziegler Jr.\" Text:  However, he returned next season to the NHL with Washington where he finished his career playing four seasons. Ziegler, along with Alan Eagleson, announced on August 6, 1979 that protective helmets would become mandatory in the NHL. The new rule had a grandfather clause that granted players who had signed pro contracts prior to June 1, 1979 the option of wearing helmets or not. Those who chose not to wear one signed liability waivers. Ziegler was the NHL's first American chief executive, and the American teams were far less hostile to the idea of a merger with the World Hockey Association than their Canadian counterparts.\n[5] Title: \"21st National Hockey League All-Star Game\" Text:  Helmets would not become mandatory in the NHL until 1979, and even then players under contract prior to June 1, 1979 were grandfathered in provided they signed a waiver. Craig MacTavish was the last player to appear in the All-Star Game without a helmet, appearing in the 1996 All-Star Game during his second-to-last season as a player. On the day of the all-star game, the National Hockey League Writers' Association proposed that a trophy should be presented in Masterton's honor, and by the end of the season, the league made it a reality.\nQuestion: when did hockey players have to wear helmets\nYour answer: ",

Later, Joshua was identified as one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore and report on the land of Canaan (), and only he and Caleb gave an encouraging report, a reward for which would be that only these two of their entire generation would enter the promised land (). According to , God appointed Joshua to succeed Moses as leader of the Israelites along with giving him a blessing of invincibility during his lifetime (Joshua 1:5).\n[2] Title: \"Book of Numbers\" Text:  Twelve spies are sent out into Canaan and come back to report to Moses. Joshua and Caleb, two of the spies, report that the land is abundant and is \"\"flowing with milk and honey\"\", but the other spies say that it is inhabited by giants, and the Israelites refuse to enter the land. Yahweh decrees that the Israelites will be punished for their loss of faith by having to wander in the wilderness for 40 years. Moses is ordered by God to make plates to cover the altar.\n[3] Title: Moses Text:  In his final act at Sinai, God gave Moses instructions for the Tabernacle, the mobile shrine by which he would travel with Israel to the Promised Land. From Sinai, Moses led the Israelites to the Desert of Paran on the border of Canaan. From there he sent twelve spies into the land. The spies returned with samples of the land's fertility, but warned that its inhabitants were giants. The people were afraid and wanted to return to Egypt, and some rebelled against Moses and against God. Moses told the Israelites that they were not worthy to inherit the land, and would wander the wilderness for forty years until the generation who had refused to enter Canaan had died, so that it would be their children who would possess the land.\n[4] Title: \"Book of Numbers\" Text:  Numbers begins at Mount Sinai, where the Israelites have received their laws and covenant from God and God has taken up residence among them in the sanctuary. The task before them is to take possession of the Promised Land. The people are counted and preparations are made for resuming their march. The Israelites begin the journey, but they \"\"murmur\"\" at the hardships along the way, and about the authority of Moses and Aaron. For these acts, God destroys approximately 15,000 of them through various means. They arrive at the borders of Canaan and send spies into the land.\n[5] Title: Shlach Text:  In response, God pardoned, but also swore that none of the men who had seen God's signs would see the Promised Land, except Caleb and Joshua. In the fourth reading (, \"\"aliyah\"\"), God swore that all of the men 20 years old and up, except Caleb and Joshua, would die in the wilderness. God said that the Israelites' children would enter the Promised Land after roaming the wilderness, suffering for the faithlessness of the present generation, for 40 years, corresponding to the number of days that the scouts scouted the land.\nQuestion: who were the two spies who gave a good report of the promised land\nYour answer: ",

He was also Prime Minister (1945\u20131955) and President (1945\u20131969) of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam).

As the Sino-Soviet split widened in the following months, Hanoi began to play the two communist giants off against each other. The North Vietnamese leadership approved tentative measures to revive the southern insurgency in December 1956.

The single bone in the thigh is called the femur. This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high proportion of bone tissue), and forms a ball and socket joint at the hip, and a modified hinge joint at the knee. The femur is the only bone in the thigh and serves for an attachment site for all muscles in the thigh.\n[4] Title: Thigh Text:  The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and kneecap forming the knee. By most measures the femur is the strongest bone in the body. The femur is also the longest bone in the body. The femur is categorised as a long bone and comprises a diaphysis, the shaft (or body) and two epiphysis or extremities that articulate with adjacent bones in the hip and knee. In cross-section, the thigh is divided up into three separate compartments, divided by fascia, each containing muscles.\n[5] Title: Thigh Text:  The \"\"venae perfortantes\"\" connect the deep and the superficial system, which consists of the saphenous veins (the site of varicose veins).

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Service Management Facility\" Text:  Services are software objects that provide a set of capabilities to other software. For example, a webserver provides HTTP service to web browsers. Other services include NFS for sharing files on a network, DHCP for dynamic IP address assignment, and Secure Shell for remote logins. Even higher level functions can be services, such as specific databases for e-commerce, finance, manufacturing control, etc. Typically, services are automatically started at boot up, long-lived, have common states (e.g. running, not running), relationship & dependencies (Sendmail service depends on Naming service, which depends on Networking services), and are critical to the dedicated function of the server.\n[2] Title: \"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\" Text:  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on UDP/IP networks whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks. A DHCP server enables computers to request IP addresses and networking parameters automatically from the Internet service provider (ISP), reducing the need for a network administrator or a user to manually assign IP addresses to all network devices. In the absence of a DHCP server, a computer or other device on the network needs to be manually assigned an IP address, or to assign itself an APIPA address, which will not enable it to communicate outside its local subnet.\n[3] Title: \"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\" Text:  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on UDP/IP networks whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks. A DHCP server enables computers to request IP addresses and networking parameters automatically from the Internet service provider (ISP), reducing the need for a network\n[4] Title: \"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\" Text:  The DHCP operates based on the client\u2013server model. When a computer or other device connects to a network, the DHCP client software sends a DHCP broadcast query requesting the necessary information. Any DHCP server on the network may service the request. The DHCP server manages a pool of IP addresses and information about client configuration parameters such as default gateway, domain name, the name servers, and time servers. On receiving a DHCP request, the DHCP server may respond with specific information for each client, as previously configured by an administrator, or with a specific address and any other information valid for the entire network and for the time period for which the allocation (\"\"lease\"\") is valid.\n[5] Title: \"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\" Text:  A DHCP client typically queries for this information immediately after booting, and periodically thereafter before the expiration of the information. When a DHCP client refreshes an assignment, it initially requests the same parameter values, but the DHCP server may assign a new address based on the assignment policies set by administrators. On large networks that consist of multiple links, a single DHCP server may service the entire network when aided by DHCP relay agents located on the interconnecting routers. Such agents relay messages between DHCP clients and DHCP servers located on different subnets.\nQuestion: dhcp can be placed into what category of service\nYour answer: ",

There Darby realized that he could sell more kitchen wares if he could replace brass with a cheaper metal, namely, cast iron. Initial experiments to cast iron in sand molds were unsuccessful, but with the aid of one of his workers, James Thomas, a Welshman, he succeeded in casting iron cookware. In 1707 he obtained a patent for the process of casting iron in sand, which derived from the Dutch process. Thus the term \"\"Dutch oven\"\" has endured for over 300 years, since at least 1710.\n[2] Title: \"Dutch oven\" Text:  During the 17th century, brass was the preferred metal for English cookware and domestic utensiles, and the Dutch produced it at the lowest cost, which, however, was still expensive. In 1702, Abraham Darby was a partner in the Brass Works Company of Bristol, which made malt mills for breweries. Apparently in 1704, Darby visited the Netherlands, where he studied the Dutch methods of working brass, including the casting of brass pots. Darby learned that when making castings, the Dutch used molds made of sand rather than the traditional loam and clay, and this innovation produced a finer finish on their brassware.\n[3] Title: \"Dutch oven\" Text:  In the Netherlands, a Dutch oven is called a , which literally translates to roasting pan. Another name for it is sudderpan, which literally translates to 'simmerpan' or 'simmering pot'. The design most used today is a black (with blue inside) enameled steel pan that is suitable for gas and induction heating. The model was introduced in 1891 by BK, a well known Dutch manufacturer of cookware. Cheaper and lighter in weight than cast iron, it proved to be a revolution in the kitchen. A braadpan is mainly used for frying meat only, but it can also be used for making traditional stews such as hach\u00e9e.\n[4] Title: \"Dutch oven\" Text:  Dutch oven A Dutch oven is a thick-walled cooking pot with a tight-fitting lid. Dutch ovens are usually made of seasoned cast iron; however, some Dutch ovens are instead made of cast aluminium, or are ceramic. Some metal varieties are enameled rather than being seasoned. Dutch ovens have been used as cooking vessels for hundreds of years. They are called casserole dishes in English-speaking countries other than the United States ( means \"\"pot\"\" in French), and in French. They are similar to both the Japanese and the , a traditional Balkan cast-iron oven, and are related to the South African , the Australian Bedourie oven and Spanish .\n[5] Title: \"Dutch oven\" Text:  American Dutch ovens changed over time during the colonial era. These changes included a shallower pot, legs to hold the oven above the coals, and a lid flange to keep the coals on the lid and out of the food. Paul Revere is credited with the design of the flat lid with a ridge for holding coals as well as the addition of legs to the pots. Colonists and settlers valued cast-iron cookware because of its versatility and durability. Cooks used them to boil, bake, stew, fry, and roast.\nQuestion: where did the phrase dutch oven come from\nYour answer: ",

Riley's record sold over six million copies as a single. It made Riley the first woman to top both the \"\"Billboard\"\" Hot 100 and the U.S. Hot Country Singles charts with the same song, a feat that would go un-repeated until Dolly Parton's \"\"9 to 5\"\" in 1981.\n[3] Title: \"Jeannie C. Riley\" Text:  The song spawned a 1978 film and a 1981-83 television series, both titled \"\"Harper Valley PTA\"\" and both starring Barbara Eden as the widow Mrs. Johnson. During the late 1960s and into the very early 1970s, Riley ranked among the most popular female vocalists in the country music industry. She had five Grammy Award nominations and four Country Music Association nominations, and performed a duet with Loretta Lynn. She had success on the country charts again, but on a lesser scale. Other hits following \"\"Harper Valley PTA\"\" include \"\"The Girl Most Likely,\"\" \"\"There Never Was A Time,\"\" \"\"The Rib,\"\" \"\"The Back Side of Dallas,\"\" \"\"Country Girl,\"\" \"\"Oh Singer,\"\" and \"\"Good Enough to Be Your Wife.\"\"\n[4] Title: \"Harper Valley PTA\" Text:  He liked the sound of the name and decided to write a song using a similar place name.

The song was later the inspiration for a 1978 motion picture and a short-lived 1981 television series, both starring Barbara Eden, playing the heroine of the story, Mrs. Johnson\u2014who now had a first name, Stella. Several other songs in the \"\"Harper Valley PTA\"\" album told stories of some of the other characters from the title tune, including Mayor Harper, Widow Jones, and Shirley Thompson.\n[5] Title: \"Harper Valley PTA (TV series)\" Text:  Harper Valley PTA (TV series) Harper Valley PTA (known simply as Harper Valley during its second season) is an American sitcom based on the 1978 film of the same name, which was itself based on the 1968 country song of the same name recorded by singer Jeannie C. Riley and written by Tom T. Hall. The series, starring Barbara Eden who reprised her role from the film, aired on NBC from January 16, 1981 to August 14, 1982.

William Thompson and Joseph Hickey see common incomes for the upper class as those exceeding $500,000 with upper middle class incomes ranging from the high 5-figures to most commonly in excess of $100,000. They claim the lower middle class ranges from $35,000 to $75,000; $16,000 to $30,000 for the working class and less than $2,000 for the lower class.\n[2] Title: \"American middle class\" Text:  Many social scientists including economist Michael Zweig and sociologist Dennis Gilbert contend that middle class persons usually have above median incomes. As social classes lack clear boundaries and overlap there are no definite income thresholds as for what is considered middle class. In 2004, sociologist Leonard Beeghley identifies a male making $57,000 and a female making $40,000 with a combined households income of $97,000 as a typical middle-class family. In 2005, sociologists William Thompson and Joseph Hickey estimate an income range of roughly $35,000 to $75,000 for the lower middle class and $100,000 or more for the upper middle class.\n[3] Title: \"Social class in the United States\" Text:  Sociologist Leonard Beeghley identifies a husband making roughly $57,000 and a wife making roughly $40,000 with a household income of roughly $97,000 as a typical middle-class family. Sociologists William Thompson and Joseph Hickey identify household incomes between $35,000 and $75,000 as typical for the lower middle and $100,000 or more as typical for the upper middle class. Though it needs to be noted that household income distribution neither reflects standard of living nor class status with complete accuracy. Those households more or less at the center of society may be referred to as being part of the American middle or middle-middle class in vernacular language use.\n[4] Title: \"American middle class\" Text:  In all three class models the lower middle class is said to consist of \"\"semi-professionals\"\" and lower level white collar employees. An adaptation by sociologists Brian K. William, Stacy C. Sawyer, and Carl M. Wahlstrom of Dennis Gilbert's class model gave the following description of the lower middle class: Taking into account the percentages provided in the six-class model by Gilbert, as well as the model of Thompson and Hickey, one can apply U.S. Census Bureau statistics regarding income. According to these class models the lower middle class is located roughly between the 52nd and 84th percentile of society.\n[5] Title: \"Social class in the United States\" Text:  The upper middle or professional class constitutes the upper end of the middle class which consists of highly educated, well-paid professionals with considerable work autonomy. The lower end of the middle class \u2013 called either lower middle class or just middle class \u2013 consists of semi-professionals, craftsmen, office staff, and sales employees who often have college degrees and are very loosely supervised.

It authorised the Working Committee to launch a civil disobedience movement throughout the country. It was decided that 26 January 1930 should be observed all over India as the \"\"Purna Swaraj\"\" (complete self-rule) Day. Many Indian political parties and Indian revolutionaries of a wide spectrum united to observe the day with honour and pride. In March 1931, the Gandhi-Irwin Pact was signed, and the government agreed to set all political prisoners free (Although, some of the great revolutionaries were not set free and the death sentence for Bhagat Singh and his two comrades was not taken back which further intensified the agitation against Congress not only outside it but within the Congress itself).\n[2] Title: \"British Raj\" Text:  At its annual session in Lahore, the Indian National Congress, under the presidency of Jawaharlal Nehru, issued a demand for \"\"Purna Swaraj\"\" (Hindustani language: \"\"complete independence\"\"), or Purna Swarajya. The declaration was drafted by the Congress Working Committee, which included Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, and Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari. Gandhi subsequently led an expanded movement of civil disobedience, culminating in 1930 with the Salt Satyagraha, in which thousands of Indians defied the tax on salt, by marching to the sea and making their own salt by evaporating seawater.\n[3] Title: \"Indian National Congress\" Text:  As a result of prevailing nationalism, Gandhi's popularity, and the party's attempts at eradicating caste differences, untouchability, poverty, and religious and ethnic divisions, Congress became a forceful and dominant group. Although its members were predominantly Hindu, it had members from other religions, economic classes, and ethnic and linguistic groups. At the Congress 1929 Lahore session under the presidency of Jawaharlal Nehru, Purna Swaraj (complete independence) was declared as the party's goal, declaring 26 January 1930 as \"\"Purna Swaraj Diwas\"\" (Independence Day).\n[4] Title: \"Purna Swaraj\" Text:  They were supported in their stand by a large number of rank-and-file Congressmen. In December 1928, Congress session was held in Kolkata and Mohandas Gandhi proposed a resolution that called for the British to grant dominion status to India within two years.

This final version was approved by joint resolution of Congress on September 25, 1789, to be forwarded to the states on September 28. By the time the debates and legislative maneuvering that went into crafting the Bill of Rights amendments was done, many personal opinions had shifted. A number of Federalists came out in support, thus silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective critique. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, were now opposed, realizing that Congressional approval of these amendments would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention.\n[2] Title: \"United States Bill of Rights\" Text:  The amendments, revised and condensed from twenty to seventeen, were approved and forwarded to the Senate on August 24, 1789. The Senate edited these amendments still further, making 26 changes of its own. Madison's proposal to apply parts of the Bill of Rights to the states as well as the federal government was eliminated, and the seventeen amendments were condensed to twelve, which were approved on September 9, 1789. The Senate also eliminated the last of Madison's proposed changes to the preamble. On September 21, 1789, a House\u2013Senate Conference Committee convened to resolve the numerous differences between the two Bill of Rights proposals.\n[3] Title: \"United States Bill of Rights\" Text:  Seven of these limitations would become part of the ten ratified Bill of Rights amendments. Ultimately, on September 25, 1789, Congress approved twelve articles of amendment to the Constitution, each consisting of one one-sentence paragraph, and submitted them to the states for ratification. Contrary to Madison's original proposal that the articles be incorporated into the main body of the Constitution, they were proposed as supplemental additions (codicils) to it. Articles Three through Twelve were ratified as additions to the Constitution on December 15, 1791, and became Amendments One through Ten of the Constitution.\n[4] Title: \"United States Bill of Rights\" Text:  United States Bill of Rights The Bill of Rights in the United States is the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution. Proposed following the often bitter 1787\u201388 debate over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and written to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people.\n[5] Title: \"United States Bill of Rights\" Text:  A procedural battle followed, and after initially forwarding the amendments to a select committee for revision, the House agreed to take Madison's proposal up as a full body beginning on July 21, 1789. The eleven-member committee made some significant changes to Madison's nine proposed amendments, including eliminating most of his preamble and adding the phrase \"\"freedom of speech, and of the press\"\". The House debated the amendments for eleven days. Roger Sherman of Connecticut persuaded the House to place the amendments at the Constitution's end so that the document would \"\"remain inviolate\"\", rather than adding them throughout, as Madison had proposed.\nQuestion: when did they write the bill of rights\nYour answer: ",

Once at the station, Canadarm2 removed \"\"Columbus\"\" from the docked shuttle's cargo bay and attached it to the starboard hatch of \"\"Harmony\"\" (also known as Node 2), with the cylinder pointing outwards on February 11, 2008. Activities in the lab are controlled on the ground by the Columbus Control Center (at DLR Oberpfaffenhofen in Germany) and by the associated User Support Operations Centres throughout Europe.\n[2] Title: \"Columbus (ISS module)\" Text:  It was launched aboard Space Shuttle \"\"Atlantis\"\" on February 7, 2008 on flight STS-122. It is designed for ten years of operation. The module is controlled by the Columbus Control Centre, located at the German Space Operations Centre, part of the German Aerospace Center in Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich, Germany. The European Space Agency has spent \u20ac1.4 billion (about US$2 billion) on building \"\"Columbus\"\", including the experiments that will fly in it and the ground control infrastructure necessary to operate them.\n[3] Title: STS-122 Text:  The connector was replaced and the shuttle launched during the third attempt on 7 February 2008. STS-122 was the ISS Assembly Flight 1E, which delivered the European \"\"Columbus\"\" laboratory module to the station, along with the Biolab, Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL), European Drawer Rack (EDR), and European Physiology Modules (EPM) payloads. STS-122 also carried the Solar Monitoring Observatory (SOLAR), the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF), and a new Nitrogen Tank Assembly, mounted in the cargo bay of an ICC-Lite payload rack, as well as a spare Drive Lock Assembly (DLA) sent to orbit in support of possible repairs to the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ) which is malfunctioning.\n[4] Title: \"Space Shuttle Atlantis\" Text:  Columbus laboratory is the largest single contribution to the ISS made by the European Space Agency (ESA). In May 2009 \"\"Atlantis\"\" flew a seven-member crew to the Hubble Space Telescope for its Servicing Mission 4, STS-125. The mission was a success, with the crew completing five spacewalks totalling 37 hours to install new cameras, batteries, a gyroscope and other components to the telescope. This was the final mission not to the ISS. The longest mission flown using \"\"Atlantis\"\" was STS-117 which lasted almost 14 days in June 2007.\n[5] Title: STS-122 Text:  \"\"Houston and Munich, the European Columbus laboratory module is now part of the ISS,\"\" Eyharts radioed to the ground.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Ribonucleotide Text:  Prior to James Watson and Francis Crick's landmark paper that detailed the structure of DNA from Rosalind Franklin's X-ray crystallography image, there were several historical scientists that also contributed to its discovery. Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss physician, who, in 1869, was first to isolate and identify nucleic substance from the nuclei of white blood cells he later called \u201cnuclein\u201d, paving the way for the discovery of DNA. Following Mieschers work, was the German biochemist, Albrecht Kossel, who, in 1878, isolated the non-protein components of \u201cnuclein\u201d, and discovered the five nucleobases present in nucleic acids: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine and uracil.\n[2] Title: Ribonucleotide Text:  Although some fundamental facts were known about nucleic acids due to these early discoveries, its structure and function remained a mystery. It wasn\u2019t until the discovery of nucleotides in 1919 by Phoebus Levene, a Russian-Lithuanian biochemist that re-opened the gates of the DNA discovery. Levene first identified the carbohydrate component present in yeast RNA was in fact ribose. However, it was not until his discovery that the carbohydrate component in thymus nucleic acid was also a sugar but lacked one oxygen atom, termed deoxyribose, that his discovery was widely appreciated by the scientific community.\n[3] Title: \"Eukaryotic chromosome structure\" Text:  The double helix was discovered in 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick. Other researchers made very important, but unconnected findings about the composition of DNA. But it was up to Watson and Crick to put all of those findings together to come up with a model for DNA. Later, chemist Alexander Todd determined that the backbone of a DNA molecule contained repeating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups. The biochemist Erwin Chargaff found that adenine and thymine always paired while cytosine and guanine always paired. High resolution X-ray images of DNA that were obtained by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin suggested a helical, or corkscrew like shape.\n[4] Title: \"History of molecular biology\" Text:  Chargaff had observed that the proportions of the four nucleotides vary between one DNA sample and the next, but that for particular pairs of nucleotides \u2014 adenine and thymine, guanine and cytosine \u2014 the two nucleotides are always present in equal proportions. Using X-ray diffraction, as well as other data from Rosalind Franklin and her information that the bases were paired, James Watson and Francis Crick arrived at the first accurate model of DNA's molecular structure in 1953, which was accepted through inspection by Rosalind Franklin. The discovery was announced on February 28, 1953; the first Watson/Crick paper appeared in \"\"Nature\"\" on April 25, 1953.\n[5] Title: \"Hershey\u2013Chase experiment\" Text:  They had made this proposal based on the structural similarity that exists between the two macromolecules: both protein and DNA are linear sequences of monomers (amino acids and nucleotides, respectively). Once the Hershey\u2013Chase experiment was published, the scientific community generally acknowledged that DNA was the genetic code material. This discovery led to a more detailed investigation of DNA to determine its composition as well as its 3D structure. Using X-ray crystallography, the structure of DNA was discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick with the help of previously documented experimental evidence by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin.\nQuestion: who discovered the basic structure of dna nucleotides\nYour answer: ",

With the win, Carolina advanced to Super Bowl 50, the team's first appearance in thirteen years. The Panthers were defeated by the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl by a score of 24\u201310. At the NFL Honors, which took place the day before the Super Bowl, it was announced Newton had won the NFL MVP award, becoming the first Panther to ever win the honor.\n[4] Title: \"Super Bowl XXXVIII\" Text:  Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XXXVIII was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2003 season. The Patriots defeated the Panthers by a score of 32\u201329. The game was played at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas, on February 1, 2004. At the time, this was the most watched Super Bowl ever with 144.4 million viewers. The Panthers were making their first ever Super Bowl appearance after posting an 11\u20135 regular season record.\n[5] Title: \"Carolina Panthers\" Text:  The Panthers improved to in the 2003 regular season, winning the NFC South and making it to Super Bowl XXXVIII before losing to the New England Patriots, 32\u201329, in what was immediately hailed by sportswriter Peter King as the \"\"Greatest Super Bowl of all time\"\". King felt the game \"\"was a wonderful championship battle, full of everything that makes football dramatic, draining, enervating, maddening, fantastic, exciting\"\" and praised, among other things, the unpredictability, coaching, and conclusion. The game is still viewed as one of the best Super Bowls of all time, and in the opinion of Charlotte-based NPR reporter Scott Jagow, the Panthers' Super Bowl appearance represented the arrival of Charlotte onto the national scene.\nQuestion: how many times has carolina panthers been to the super bowl\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Mad World\" Text:  Mad World \"\"Mad World\"\" is a 1982 song by the British band Tears for Fears. Written by Roland Orzabal and sung by bassist Curt Smith, it was the band's third single release and first chart hit, reaching number 3 on the UK Singles Chart in November 1982. Both \"\"Mad World\"\" and its B-side, \"\"Ideas as Opiates\"\", appeared on the band's debut LP \"\"The Hurting\"\" (1983). \"\"Mad World\"\" has since been covered by various artists, most notably by Michael Andrews and Gary Jules for the soundtrack of the film \"\"Donnie Darko\"\" in 2001.\n[2] Title: \"Mad World\" Text:  This version was a UK number one hit and won Orzabal his second Ivor Novello Award in 2003. \"\"Mad World\"\" was originally written on acoustic guitar when Orzabal was 19 after being inspired to write a new wave song in the vein of Duran Duran's \"\"Girls on Film\"\". After a few false starts with Orzabal on vocals, he suggested Smith sing it and \"\"suddenly it sounded fabulous\"\". \"\"Mad World\"\" was intended to be the B-side for the band's second single \"\"Pale Shelter (You Don't Give Me Love)\"\", but their record company stated that \"\"Mad World\"\" could be a single in its own right.\n[3] Title: \"Mad World\" Text:  The band then opted to re-record \"\"Mad World\"\" with producers Ross Cullum and Chris Hughes, a former drummer with Adam and the Ants. Curt Smith's ad lib in the song's final chorus resulted in a mondegreen. Smith clarified the actual lyric in 2010: The song was influenced by the theories of Arthur Janov, author of \"\"The Primal Scream\"\", and the lyric \"\"the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had\"\" suggests that dreams of intense experiences such as death will be the best at releasing tension.\n[4] Title: \"Mad World\" Text:  While the Tears for Fears version featured synthesisers and heavy percussion, the Andrews/Jules version was stripped down; instead of a full musical backing, it used only a set of piano chords, a mellotron imitating a cello, very light touches of electric piano, and modest use of a vocoder on the chorus. Their version was originally released on CD in 2002 on the film's soundtrack, but an increasing cult-following spawned by the film's DVD release finally prompted Jules and Andrews to issue the song as a proper single. It was released through Sanctuary Records on 15 December 2003, in time for the race for the UK's Christmas number one, beating \"\"Christmas Time (Don't Let the Bells End)\"\" by The Darkness to take the title the following week.\n[5] Title: \"Michael Andrews (musician)\" Text:  Like many of his role models for soundtrack composing such as John Barry and Ennio Morricone, Andrews wanted to put a song on his otherwise instrumental score. He chose the song \"\"Mad World\"\" by Tears for Fears (originally released in 1982) and his childhood friend Gary Jules sings as Andrews plays piano. The music was not available on a soundtrack album until Andy Factor, a friend of Andrews, released it on his Everloving Records independent label in 2002. As \"\"Donnie Darko\"\" was not a hit at first, there was little interest in the soundtrack in the US.\nQuestion: who sang it 's a mad world original\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Energy storage\" Text:  Capacitors are commonly used in electronic devices to maintain power supply while batteries change. (This prevents loss of information in volatile memory.) Conventional capacitors provide less than 360 joules per kilogram, while a conventional alkaline battery has a density of 590 kJ/kg. Capacitors store energy in an electrostatic field between their plates. Given a potential difference across the conductors (e.g., when a capacitor is attached across a battery), an electric field develops across the dielectric, causing positive charge (+Q) to collect on one plate and negative charge (-Q) to collect on the other plate.\n[2] Title: \"Electric potential energy\" Text:  The electrostatic potential energy stored in the system of three charges is: The energy density, or energy per unit volume, formula_9, of the electrostatic field of a continuous charge distribution is: Some elements in a circuit can convert energy from one form to another. For example, a resistor converts electrical energy to heat. This is known as the Joule effect. A capacitor stores it in its electric field. The total electric potential energy stored in a capacitor is given by where \"\"C\"\" is the capacitance, \"\"V\"\" is the electric potential difference, and \"\"Q\"\" the charge stored in the capacitor.\n[3] Title: Capacitor Text:  In this case the stored energy can be calculated from the electric field strength The last formula above is equal to the energy density per unit volume in the electric field multiplied by the volume of field between the plates, confirming that the energy in the capacitor is stored in its electric field. The current \"\"I\"\"(\"\"t\"\") through any component in an electric circuit is defined as the rate of flow of a charge \"\"Q\"\"(\"\"t\"\") passing through it, but actual charges\u2014electrons\u2014cannot pass through the dielectric layer of a capacitor.\n[4] Title: Capacitor Text:  where formula_33 is the charge stored in the capacitor, formula_14 is the voltage across the capacitor, and formula_35 is the capacitance. This potential energy will remain in the capacitor until the charge is removed. If charge is allowed to move back from the positive to the negative plate, for example by connecting a circuit with resistance between the plates, the charge moving under the influence of the electric field will do work on the external circuit. If the gap between the capacitor plates formula_4 is constant, as in the parallel plate model above, the electric field between the plates will be uniform (neglecting fringing fields) and will have a constant value formula_37.\n[5] Title: \"Energy storage\" Text:  The organic compound \"\"norbornadiene\"\" converts to \"\"quadricyclane\"\" upon exposure to light, storing solar energy as the energy of chemical bonds. A working system has been developed in Sweden as a molecular solar thermal system. A capacitor (originally known as a 'condenser') is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store energy electrostatically. Practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors (plates) separated by a dielectric (i.e., insulator). A capacitor can store electric energy when disconnected from its charging circuit, so it can be used like a temporary battery, or like other types of rechargeable energy storage system.\nQuestion: what type of energy is stored in a capacitor\nYour answer: ",

It weaves together the past and the present through the blossoming friendship between Evelyn Couch, a middle-aged housewife, and Ninny Threadgoode, an elderly woman who lives in a nursing home. Every week Evelyn visits Ninny, who tells her stories about her youth in Whistle Stop, Alabama where her sister-in-law, Idgie, and her friend, Ruth, ran a caf\u00e9. These stories, along with Ninny's friendship, enable Evelyn to begin a new, satisfying life while allowing the people and stories of Ninny's youth to live on.\n[4] Title: \"Fannie Flagg\" Text:  The novel is told in both past and present tense by the characters Ninnie Threadgoode (past) and Evelyn Couch (present) and focuses on the town of Whistle Stop, Alabama, circa the 1920s and 1930s. It is about the unlikely bonds forged between women who seemingly have nothing in common except restlessness. Flagg subsequently wrote the screenplay based on that book, which became the 1991 film \"\"Fried Green Tomatoes\"\". The movie garnered her a nomination for an Academy Award. \"\"Fried Green Tomatoes\"\" starred Jessica Tandy, Kathy Bates, Mary Stuart Masterson, Mary-Louise Parker and Cicely Tyson.\n[5] Title: \"Fried Green Tomatoes\" Text:  Fried Green Tomatoes Fried Green Tomatoes is a 1991 comedy-drama film based on the novel \"\"Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe\"\" by Fannie Flagg.

It reached number one in the British, Irish, Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand singles charts in 1960. The chorus of the song is: The song was written by Lonnie Donegan, Peter Buchanan (Donegan's manager between 1956 and 1962), and Beverly Thorn; Thorn was not credited on the original release. According to his autobiography, Beverley Thorn was a pseudonym of Leslie Bricusse, the songwriter who wrote hit shows with Anthony Newley.\n[2] Title: \"My Old Man's a Dustman\" Text:  A version titled \"\"My Old Man's a Provo\"\" became one of the most popular Irish republican rebel folk songs in the latter part of the twentieth century.

It reached number one in the British, Irish, Australian, Canadian,\n[3] Title: \"My Old Man's a Dustman\" Text:  The song represented a change in style for Donegan, away from American folk and towards British music hall. On 16 March 1960, through Pye Records in the UK, Donegan released a version of the song recorded live at the Gaumont cinema in Doncaster just a few weeks earlier, on 20 February. The B-side was a version of the English folk song \"\"The Golden Vanity\"\". The single reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on 31 March and maintained that position for four weeks. It also reached number one in Ireland, Australia and New Zealand and on the Canadian CHUM Chart, selling over a million copies in total.\n[4] Title: \"Lonnie Donegan\" Text:  He turned to music hall style with \"\"My Old Man's a Dustman\"\" which was not well received by skiffle fans and unsuccessful in America on Atlantic in 1960. But it reached number one in the UK. Donegan's group had a flexible line-up, but was generally Denny Wright or Les Bennetts (of Les Hobeaux and Days of Skiffle, led by singer Dave George), playing lead guitar and singing harmony, Micky Ashman or Pete Huggett \u2013 later Steve Jones \u2013 on upright bass, Nick Nichols \u2013 later Pete Appleby, Mark Goodwin and Ken Rodway (now a Christian author and minister) on drums or percussion, and Donegan playing acoustic guitar or banjo and singing the lead.\n[5] Title: Skiffle Text:  Similarly, the Bee Gees developed from Barry Gibb's skiffle group the Rattlesnakes. After splitting from Barber, Donegan went on to make a series of popular records as \"\"Lonnie Donegan's Skiffle Group\"\", with successes including \"\"Cumberland Gap\"\" (1957), \"\"Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavour\"\" (1958) and \"\"My Old Man's a Dustman\"\" (1960). However, the British rock and roll scene was starting to take off, producing home-grown stars like Tommy Steele, Marty Wilde and Cliff Richard and the Shadows (themselves originally involved in skiffle).\nQuestion: who wrote my old man 's a dustman\nYour answer: ",

Short segments show band members trying to live out their assorted daydreams, only to be teased, tormented, and made fools of by a body-painted vixen. Fairly primitive by the band's later standards, the video was shot on a sound stage at St John's Wood.\n[2] Title: \"Rio (song)\" Text:  When the video was featured on VH1's \"\"Pop-Up Video\"\", it mentions that after the video was completed, Mulcahy, Simon LeBon, and John Taylor went for a swim and were inches away from sharks when the yacht captain yelled for them to get out of the water. Nick Rhodes was reportedly seasick during the filming, and has often said \"\"I hate boats unless they're tied up and you're having cocktails on them.\"\" While in Antigua, the band also filmed a video for the album track \"\"Night Boat\"\", which appeared with \"\"Rio\"\" and nine other videos on the \"\"Duran Duran\"\" video album released in 1983.\n[3] Title: \"Rio (Duran Duran album)\" Text:  The band had their own plans and ambitions for promotion. They reunited with director Russell Mulcahy (who had directed the music video for their first single, \"\"Planet Earth\"\"), and planned the release of a full length video album\u2014eleven videos for the best songs off of the \"\"Duran Duran\"\" and \"\"Rio\"\" albums. The band travelled to Sri Lanka and Antigua between tour dates to film the memorable videos for the singles \"\"Rio\"\", \"\"Hungry Like the Wolf\"\" and \"\"Save a Prayer\"\", as well as the lesser-known \"\"Lonely in Your Nightmare\"\" and \"\"Night Boat\"\" \u2014 the latter video being a creepy zombiefest set on a deserted island.\n[4] Title: \"Duran Duran\" Text:  Because MTV was not available everywhere in the United States at first, it was easy to see a pattern: where MTV went, listener demand for Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, Def Leppard and other European bands with interesting videos went through the roof. The band's sun-drenched videos for \"\"Rio\"\", \"\"Hungry Like the Wolf\"\" and \"\"Save A Prayer\"\", and the surreal \"\"Is There Something I Should Know?\"\" were filmed by future movie director Russell Mulcahy, who made eleven videos for the band.\n[5] Title: \"Duran Duran\" Text:  The video was heavily edited for MTV (Music Television). The album peaked in the UK top twenty at number 3. Later in 1981 the band embarked on their first United States club tour followed by more dates in Germany and the UK. This second tour of Britain coincided with a wave of riots sparked by unemployment and racial tension, including those of Moss Side and Toxteth. The band played Birmingham the day after the Handsworth riots. Duran Duran began to achieve worldwide recognition in 1982. In May they released their second album, \"\"Rio\"\", which scored four UK Top Twenty singles with \"\"My Own Way\"\", \"\"Hungry Like the Wolf\"\", \"\"Save a Prayer\"\", and the title song \"\"Rio\"\".\nQuestion: who played rio in the duran duran video\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" Text:  The Importance of Being Earnest The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde. First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious person\u00e6 to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Some contemporary reviews praised the play's humour and the culmination of Wilde's artistic career, while others were cautious about its lack of social messages.\n[2] Title: \"Comedy of manners\" Text:  Oscar Wilde's play, \"\"The Importance of Being Earnest\"\" (1895), which satirized the Victorian morality of the time, is one of the best-known plays of this genre. The comedy of manners was first developed in the New Comedy period of ancient Greek comedy and is known today primarily from fragments of writings by the Greek playwright Menander. Menander's style, elaborate plots, and stock characters were imitated by the ancient Roman playwrights, such as Plautus and Terence, whose comedies were in turn widely known and reproduced during the Renaissance.\n[3] Title: \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" Text:  The play repeatedly mocks Victorian traditions and social customs, marriage and the pursuit of love in particular. In Victorian times \"\"earnestness\"\" was considered to be the over-riding societal value, originating in religious attempts to reform the lower classes, it spread to the upper ones too throughout the century. The play's very title, with its mocking paradox (serious people are so because they do \"\"not\"\" see trivial comedies), introduces the theme, it continues in the drawing room discussion, \"\"Yes, but you must be serious about it.\n[4] Title: \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" Text:  Similarly, Wilde's use of dialogue mocks the upper classes of Victorian England lending the play a satirical tone. Reinhart further stipulates that the use of farcical humour to mock the upper classes \"\"merits the play both as satire and as drama\"\". Wilde's two final comedies, \"\"An Ideal Husband\"\" and \"\"The Importance of Being Earnest\"\", were still on stage in London at the time of his prosecution, and they were soon closed as the details of his case became public.\n[5] Title: \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" Text:  \"\"The Importance of Being Earnest\"\" is Wilde's most popular work and is continually revived. Max Beerbohm called the play Wilde's \"\"finest, most undeniably his own\"\", saying that in his other comedies\u2014\"\"Lady Windermere's Fan\"\", \"\"A Woman of No Importance\"\" and \"\"An Ideal Husband\"\"\u2014the plot, following the manner of Victorien Sardou, is unrelated to the theme of the work, while in \"\"Earnest\"\" the story is \"\"dissolved\"\" into the form of the play.\nQuestion: what kind of comedy is the importance of being earnest\nYour answer: ",

It was the first international organisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace. Its primary goals, as stated in its Covenant, included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration. Other issues in this and related treaties included labour conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants, human and drug trafficking, the arms trade, global health, prisoners of war, and protection of minorities in Europe.\n[2] Title: \"League of Nations\" Text:  Current consensus views that, even though the League failed to achieve its ultimate goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, giving a voice to smaller nations; helped to raise awareness to problems like epidemics, slavery, child labour, colonial tyranny, refugee crisis and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under international observation.\n[3] Title: \"League of Nations\" Text:  The Council met, on average, five times a year and in extraordinary sessions when required. In total, 107 sessions were held between 1920 and 1939. The League oversaw the Permanent Court of International Justice and several other agencies and commissions created to deal with pressing international problems. These included the Disarmament Commission, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Mandates Commission, the International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation (precursor to UNESCO), the Permanent Central Opium Board, the Commission for Refugees, and the Slavery Commission. Three of these institutions were transferred to the United Nations after the Second World War: the International Labour Organization, the Permanent Court of International Justice (as the International Court of Justice), and the Health Organisation (restructured as the World Health Organization).\n[4] Title: \"League of Nations\" Text:  Its principal sections were Political, Financial and Economics, Transit, Minorities and Administration (administering the Saar and Danzig), Mandates, Disarmament, Health, Social (Opium and Traffic in Women and Children), Intellectual Cooperation and International Bureaux, Legal, and Information. The staff of the Secretariat was responsible for preparing the agenda for the Council and the Assembly and publishing reports of the meetings and other routine matters, effectively acting as the League's civil service. In 1931 the staff numbered 707. The Assembly consisted of representatives of all members of the League, with each state allowed up to three representatives and one vote.\n[5] Title: \"League of Nations\" Text:  It met in Geneva and, after its initial sessions in 1920, it convened once a year in September. The special functions of the Assembly included the admission of new members, the periodical election of non-permanent members to the Council, the election with the Council of the judges of the Permanent Court, and control of the budget. In practice, the Assembly was the general directing force of League activities. The League Council acted as a type of executive body directing the Assembly's business. It began with four permanent members (Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan) and four non-permanent members that were elected by the Assembly for a three-year term.\nQuestion: what is the main purpose of the league of nations\nYour answer: ",

Free-born women in ancient Rome were citizens \"\"(cives)\"\", but could not vote or hold political office. The form of Roman marriage called \"\"conubium\"\", for instance, requires that both spouses be citizens; like men from towns granted \"\"civitas sine suffragio\"\", women eligible for legal marriage were citizens without suffrage.\n[2] Title: \"Social class in ancient Rome\" Text:  Notable examples of \"\"novi homines\"\" are the seven-time consul Marius, and Cicero, whose rise was unusual in that it was driven by his oratorical and intellectual abilities rather than, as with Marius, military success. During the Empire, \"\"patricius\"\" became a title of nobility bestowed by emperors. The census divided citizens into six complex classes based on property. The richest were the senatorial class, who during the Late Republic had to be worth at least 400,000 \"\"sestertii\"\", the same as the \"\"equites\"\"; when Augustus reformed the senate during the first years of the Principate, he raised the property requirement to 1,000,000 \"\"sestertii\"\".\n[3] Title: \"Social class in ancient Rome\" Text:  The wealth of the senatorial class was based on ownership of large agricultural estates, and by custom members did not engage in commercial activity. Below the \"\"senatores\"\" in rank, but above others were the \"\"equites\"\" (\u201cequestrians\u201d or \u201cknights\u201d), with 400,000 \"\"sestertii\"\", who could engage in commerce and formed an influential business class. Certain political and quasi-political positions were filled by \"\"equites\"\", including tax farming and, under the Principate, leadership of the Praetorian Guard.\n[4] Title: \"Insula (building)\" Text:  Insula (building) In Roman architecture, an insula (Latin for \"\"island\"\", plural \"\"insulae\"\") was a kind of apartment building that housed most of the urban citizen population of ancient Rome, including ordinary people of lower- or middle-class status (the \"\"plebs\"\") and all but the wealthiest from the upper-middle class (the \"\"equites\"\"). The term was also used to mean a city block. The traditional elite and the very wealthy lived in a \"\"domus\"\", a large single-family residence, but the two kinds of housing were intermingled in the city and not segregated into separate neighborhoods.\n[5] Title: \"Ancient Rome\" Text:  The low Plebeian and middle Equestrian classes lived in the city center, packed into apartments, or Insulae, which were almost like modern ghettos. These areas, often built by upper class property owners to rent, were often centred upon collegia or taberna. These people, provided with a free supply of grain, and entertained by gladatorial games, were enrolled as clients of patrons among the upper class Patricians, whose assistance they sought and whose interests they upheld.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: IPsec Text:  Internet Protocol security (IPsec) uses cryptographic security services to protect communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. IPsec supports network-level peer authentication, data-origin authentication, data integrity, data confidentiality (encryption), and replay protection. The initial IPv4 suite was developed with few security provisions. As a part of the IPv4 enhancement, IPsec is a layer 3 OSI model or Internet Layer end-to-end security scheme, while some other Internet security systems in widespread use operate above layer 3, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Shell (SSH), both of which operate at the Application layer.\n[2] Title: \"Internet security\" Text:  It provides security and authentication at the IP layer by transforming data using encryption. Two main types of transformation that form the basis of IPsec: the Authentication Header (AH) and ESP. These two protocols provide data integrity, data origin authentication, and anti-replay service. These protocols can be used alone or in combination to provide the desired set of security services for the Internet Protocol (IP) layer. The basic components of the IPsec security architecture are described in terms of the following functionalities: The set of security services provided at the IP layer includes access control, data origin integrity, protection against replays, and confidentiality.\n[3] Title: IPsec Text:  IPsec can automatically secure applications at the IP layer. From 1986 to 1991, the NSA sponsored the development of security protocols for the Internet under its Secure Data Network Systems (SDNS) program. This brought together various vendors including Motorola who produced a network encryption device in 1988. The work was openly published from about 1988 by NIST and, of these, \"\"Security Protocol at Layer 3\"\" (SP3) would eventually morph into the ISO standard Network Layer Security Protocol (NLSP). From 1992 to 1995, various research groups improved upon SDNS's SP3.\n[4] Title: \"OSI model\" Text:  Higher layers may have the equivalent of double envelopes, such as cryptographic presentation services that can be read by the addressee only. Roughly speaking, tunneling protocols operate at the transport layer, such as carrying non-IP protocols such as IBM's SNA or Novell's IPX over an IP network, or end-to-end encryption with IPsec. While Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) might seem to be a network-layer protocol, if the encapsulation of the payload takes place only at the endpoint, GRE becomes closer to a transport protocol that uses IP headers but contains complete Layer 2 frames or Layer 3 packets to deliver to the endpoint.\n[5] Title: \"Internet protocol suite\" Text:  The TCP/IP model's internet layer corresponds to layer three of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, where it is referred to as the network layer. The internet layer provides an unreliable datagram transmission facility between hosts located on potentially different IP networks by forwarding the transport layer datagrams to an appropriate next-hop router for further relaying to its destination. With this functionality, the internet layer makes possible internetworking, the interworking of different IP networks, and it essentially establishes the Internet. The Internet Protocol is the principal component of the internet layer, and it defines two addressing systems to identify network hosts' computers, and to locate them on the network.\nQuestion: ipsec is defined at what layer of the osi model\nYour answer: ",

I-Pass I-Pass (stylized as I-PASS) is the electronic toll collection system utilized by the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA) on its toll highways that launched on November 18, 1993, with the opening of Interstate 355 (Veterans Memorial Tollway). It uses the same transponder as the E-ZPass system used in the Northeastern US and the Indiana Toll Road, along with the future Indiana State Road 912 (Cline Avenue) Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal bridge.\n[2] Title: I-Pass Text:  I-Pass I-Pass (stylized as I-PASS) is the electronic toll collection system utilized by the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA) on its toll highways that launched on November 18, 1993, with the opening of Interstate 355 (Veterans Memorial Tollway). It uses the same transponder as the E-ZPass system used in the Northeastern US and the Indiana Toll Road, along with the future Indiana State Road 912 (Cline Avenue) Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal bridge. I-Pass transponders can be used at all toll plazas, including those located on entrance and exit ramps.\n[3] Title: \"Illinois State Toll Highway Authority\" Text:  Drivers were handed a Hollerith card when they entered the segment and paid a toll when they left. I-Pass is the Illinois Tollway\u2019s electronic transponder toll collection system that allows drivers to pre-pay their tolls. , Tollway drivers use 3.3 million I-Pass transponders. Every toll lane on the system is equipped to accept I-Pass which can also be used on the Chicago Skyway and anywhere E-ZPass is accepted. (E-ZPass is a transponder consortium of toll road authorities on the East Coast.) A refundable deposit of $10 and $20 in pre-paid tolls is charged at the time of purchase.\n[4] Title: \"Illinois State Toll Highway Authority\" Text:  The introduction of the I-Pass system has greatly alleviated this problem since all vehicles with an I-Pass or E-Zpass can continue to travel at normal highway speeds through the toll plazas. In 2003, during Governor George Ryan's administration, the ISTHA entered into a public-private partnership with Wilton Partners to renovate the oasis rest stops in exchange for a 25-year lease. That lease has been the subject of various investigations, including the political connections between food vendors in the oases with former Governor Blagojevich. Ultimately, Wilton Partners' lender foreclosed on the Oases.\n[5] Title: \"Illinois State Toll Highway Authority\" Text:  However, a rate hike did not go into effect at that time. Ultimately, the toll rates for I-Pass users remained at 1983 prices while the toll rate for cash payers doubled. Practically, the I-Pass system and open road tolling appears to have removed the annoying aspect of toll collection which motivated many toll opponents, and subsequently the calls to ending the tolls have quieted. One aspect of the argument is that by having a single toll road system for the state that controls the major commuter routes into Chicago and the major circumferential route around the city, commuters and long-haul truckers who use the original system that was built in 1958 are subsidizing the subsequent routes, I-88 to Dixon and I-355 in DuPage County.\nQuestion: what states does the i pass work in\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Eukaryotic DNA replication\" Text:  In G phase of the cell cycle, many of the DNA replication regulatory processes are initiated. In eukaryotes, the vast majority of DNA synthesis occurs during S phase of the cell cycle, and the entire genome must be unwound and duplicated to form two daughter copies. During G, any damaged DNA or replication errors are corrected. Finally, one copy of the genomes is segregated to each daughter cell at mitosis or M phase. These daughter copies each contain one strand from the parental duplex DNA and one nascent antiparallel strand.\n[2] Title: Gene Text:  Binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as S phase, whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during M phase. The duplication and transmission of genetic material from one generation of cells to the next is the basis for molecular inheritance, and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes. Organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents because the cells of the offspring contain copies of the genes in their parents' cells.\n[3] Title: \"Eukaryotic DNA replication\" Text:  During the G stage of the cell cycle, the replication initiation factors, origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1, and minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) protein complex, bind sequentially to DNA to form the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). At the transition of the G stage to the S phase of the cell cycle, S phase\u2013specific cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) and Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase (DDK) transform the pre-RC into an active replication fork. During this transformation, the pre-RC is disassembled with the loss of Cdc6, creating the initiation complex.\n[4] Title: \"Eukaryotic DNA replication\" Text:  During the G phase of the cell cycle there are low levels of CDK activity. This low level of CDK activity allows for the formation of new pre-RC complexes but is not sufficient for DNA replication to be initiated by the newly formed pre-RCs. During the remaining phases of the cell cycle there are elevated levels of CDK activity. This high level of CDK activity is responsible for initiating DNA replication as well as inhibiting new pre-RC complex formation. Once DNA replication has been initiated the pre-RC complex is broken down. Due to the fact that CDK levels remain high during the S phase, G, and M phases of the cell cycle no new pre-RC complexes can be formed.\n[5] Title: \"Eukaryotic DNA replication\" Text:  These events are initiated by the formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) at the origins of replication. This process takes place in the G stage of the cell cycle. The pre-RC formation involves the ordered assembly of many replication factors including the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6 protein, Cdt1 protein, and minichromosome maintenance proteins (Mcm2-7). Once the pre-RC is formed, activation of the complex is triggered by two kinases, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) that help transition the pre-RC to the initiation complex prior to the initiation of DNA replication.\nQuestion: when does dna replication occur during the eukaryotic cell cycle\nYour answer: ",

He was named as one of the seven 'Unsung Heroes' by \"\"Fortune\"\" in their 'Businessmen of the Century' issue (1999-11-22). He is also known as \"\"Father of Fiber Optics\"\". The term \"\"fibre optics\"\" was coined by Singh Kapany in 1956. He is a former IOFS officer. Kapany was born to a Sikh family in Moga, Punjab, and studied at Agra University.\n[2] Title: \"Charles K.

Born in Shanghai, China, Kao was a permanent resident of Hong Kong and held citizenships in the United Kingdom and the United States. Charles Kao was born in Shanghai in 1933, and his ancestral home is in nearby Jinshan, at that time a separate administrative area.\n[3] Title: \"Charles K. Kao\" Text:  Charles K. Kao Sir Charles Kuen Kao (4 November 1933 \u2013 23 September 2018) was a physicist and electrical engineer who pioneered the development and use of fibre optics in telecommunications. In the 1960s, Kao created various methods to combine glass fibres with lasers in order to transmit digital data, which laid the groundwork for the evolution of the Internet. \"\"Communication as we know it, including the Internet, would not exist without fiber optics,\"\" said William Wulf, president of the National Academy of Engineering in 1999.\n[4] Title: \"Charles K. Kao\" Text:  In mid-1970s, he did seminal work on glass fiber fatigue strength. When named the first ITT Executive Scientist, Kao launched the \"\"Terabit Technology\"\" program in addressing the high frequency limits of signal processing, so Kao is also known as the \"\"Father of the Terabit Technology Concept\"\". Kao has published more than 100 papers and was granted over 30 patents, including the water-resistant high-strength fibers (with M. S. Maklad). At an early stage of developing optic fibres, Kao already strongly preferred single mode for long-distance optical communication, instead of using multi-mode systems.\n[5] Title: \"Charles K.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Zombie Text:  The zombie belief has its roots in traditions brought to Haiti by enslaved Africans, and their subsequent experiences in the New World. It was thought that the voodoo deity Baron Samedi would gather them from their grave to bring them to a heavenly afterlife in Africa (\"\"Guinea\"\"), unless they had offended him in some way, in which case they would be forever a slave after death, as a zombie. A zombie could also be saved by feeding them salt. English professor Amy Wilentz has written that the modern concept of Zombies was strongly influenced by Haitian slavery.\n[2] Title: Resurrection Text:  A zombie (Haitian French: \"\"\"\", ) is a fictional undead being created through the reanimation of a human corpse. Zombies are most commonly found in horror and fantasy genre works. The term comes from Haitian folklore, where a \"\"zombie\"\" is a dead body reanimated through various methods, most commonly magic. As knowledge of different religions has grown, so have claims of bodily disappearance of some religious and mythological figures. In ancient Greek religion, this was a way the gods made some physically immortal, including such figures as Cleitus, Ganymede, Menelaus, and Tithonus.\n[3] Title: Zombie Text:  Zombie A zombie (Haitian French: \"\"\"\", ) is a fictional undead being created through the reanimation of a human corpse. Zombies are most commonly found in horror and fantasy genre works. The term comes from Haitian folklore, where a \"\"zombie\"\" is a dead body reanimated through various methods, most commonly magic. Modern depictions of the reanimation of the dead do not necessarily involve magic but often invoke science fictional methods such as carriers, radiation, mental diseases, vectors, pathogens, scientific accidents, etc.\n[4] Title: Zombie Text:  In Haitian folklore, a \"\"zombie\"\" (Haitian French: \"\"zombi\"\", Haitian Creole: \"\"zonbi\"\") is an animated corpse raised by magical means, such as witchcraft. The concept has been popularly associated with the religion of voodoo, but it plays no part in that faith's formal practices. How the creatures in contemporary zombie films came to be called \"\"zombies\"\" is not fully clear. The film \"\"Night of the Living Dead\"\" made no spoken reference to its undead antagonists as \"\"zombies\"\", describing them instead as \"\"ghouls\"\" (though ghouls, which derive from Arabic folklore, are demons, not undead).\n[5] Title: Zombie Text:  Zombies are featured widely in Haitian rural folklore as dead persons physically revived by the act of necromancy of a \"\"bokor\"\", a sorcerer or witch. The \"\"bokor\"\" is opposed by the \"\"houngan\"\" or priest and the \"\"mambo\"\" or priestess of the formal voodoo religion. A zombie remains under the control of the \"\"bokor\"\" as a personal slave, having no will of its own. The Haitian tradition also includes an incorporeal type of zombie, the \"\"zombie astral\"\", which is a part of the human soul.\nQuestion: where does the concept of zombies come from\nYour answer: ",

Seasons 5 and 6 each won a dozen Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series. By the end of 2016, all seasons up to season 6 (which premiered on April 24, 2016) had been aired on HBO and all seasons had been released on DVD and/or Blu-ray for home viewing (see List of Game of Thrones episodes).\n[3] Title: \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" Text:  \"\"Game of Thrones\"\" was nominated for 15 Emmy Awards for season 3. Two days after the fourth season premiered in April 2014, HBO renewed \"\"Game of Thrones\"\" for a fifth and sixth season. Season 5 premiered on April 12, 2015 and set a Guinness World Records for winning the highest number of Emmy Awards for a series in a single season and year, winning 12 out of 24 nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series. These episodes were watched by 8 million viewers, setting a record number for the series.\n[4] Title: \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" Text:  Martin did not intend to separate the characters geographically again. In 2015 there were indications that the book would be published before the sixth season of the HBO show but in early January 2016 Martin confirmed that he had not met an end-of-year deadline that he had established with his publisher for release of the book before the sixth season. He also revealed there had been a previous deadline of October 2015 that he had considered achievable in May 2015, and that in September 2015 he had still considered the end-of-year deadline achievable. He further confirmed that some of the plot of the book might be revealed in the upcoming season of \"\"Game of Thrones\"\".\n[5] Title: \"George R. R. Martin\" Text:  Like the previous season, it would largely consist of original content not found in Martin's \"\"A Song of Ice and Fire\"\" series, but also adapts material from the upcoming sixth and seventh novels: \"\"The Winds of Winter\"\" and \"\"A Dream of Spring\"\". HBO confirmed that season 8 has been ordered and that it would be the last of the series; it will be aired in 2019. In November 2016, President of Programming Casey Bloys indicated that he had had preliminary discussions about a prequel spinoff to the \"\"Game of Thrones\"\" series with Martin.\nQuestion: when does next game of thrones season 6 start\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Esophagus Text:  The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.\n[2] Title: \"Gastrointestinal tract\" Text:  The muscularis externa of the stomach is composed of the inner oblique layer, middle circular layer and outer longitudinal layer . Between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers is the myenteric plexus. This controls peristalsis. Activity is initiated by the pacemaker cells, (myenteric interstitial cells of Cajal). The gut has intrinsic peristaltic activity (basal electrical rhythm) due to its self-contained enteric nervous system. The rate can be modulated by the rest of the autonomic nervous system. The coordinated contractions of these layers is called peristalsis and propels the food through the tract.\n[3] Title: Esophagus Text:  These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. The outermost layer of the esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa. In early embryogenesis, the esophagus develops from the endodermal primitive gut tube. The ventral part of the embryo abuts the yolk sac. During the second week of embryological development, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround parts of the sac.\n[4] Title: \"Enteric nervous system\" Text:  However, vertebrate studies show that when the vagus nerve is severed, the enteric nervous system continues to function. In vertebrates, the enteric nervous system includes efferent neurons, afferent neurons, and interneurons, all of which make the enteric nervous system capable of carrying reflexes and acting as an integrating center in the absence of CNS input. The sensory neurons report on mechanical and chemical conditions. Through intestinal muscles, the motor neurons control peristalsis and churning of intestinal contents. Other neurons control the secretion of enzymes. The enteric nervous system also makes use of more than 30 neurotransmitters, most of which are identical to the ones found in CNS, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin.\n[5] Title: \"Interstitial cell of Cajal\" Text:  Slow waves organize gut contractions into phasic contractions that are the basis for peristalsis and segmentation. The frequency of ICC pacemaker activity differs in different regions of the GI tract: ICC also mediate neural input from enteric motor neurons. Animals lacking ICC have greatly reduced responses to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, released from excitatory motor neurons, and to the transmitter nitric oxide, released from inhibitory motor neurons. Loss of ICC in disease, therefore, may interrupt normal neural control of gastrointestinal (GI) contractions and lead to functional GI disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome.\nQuestion: which nerve plexus plays a role in peristalsis\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Speed of sound\" Text:  Speed of sound The speed of sound is the distance travelled per unit time by a sound wave as it propagates through an elastic medium. At , the speed of sound in air is about 343 meters per second (1,234.8 km/h; 1,125 ft/s; 767 mph; 667 kn), or a kilometre in or a mile in . It depends strongly on temperature, but also varies by several meters per second due to which gases are present. The speed of sound in an ideal gas depends only on its temperature and composition.\n[2] Title: \"Speed of sound\" Text:  In the standard atmosphere: In fact, assuming an ideal gas, the speed of sound \"\"c\"\" depends on temperature only, not on the pressure or density (since these change in lockstep for a given temperature and cancel out). Air is almost an ideal gas. The temperature of the air varies with altitude, giving the following variations in the speed of sound using the standard atmosphere\u2014\"\"actual conditions may vary\"\". Given normal atmospheric conditions, the temperature, and thus speed of sound, varies with altitude: The medium in which a sound wave is travelling does not always respond adiabatically, and as a result, the speed of sound can vary with frequency.\n[3] Title: \"Speed of sound\" Text:  The speed has a weak dependence on frequency and pressure in ordinary air, deviating slightly from ideal behavior. In common everyday speech, \"\"speed of sound\"\" refers to the speed of sound waves in air. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: sound travels most slowly in gases; it travels faster in liquids; and faster still in solids. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at in air; it travels at in water (4.3 times as fast as in air); and at in iron (about 15 times as fast as in air).\n[4] Title: \"Speed of sound\" Text:  The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material's shear modulus and density. In fluid dynamics, the speed of sound in a fluid medium (gas or liquid) is used as a relative measure for the speed of an object moving through the medium. The ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound in the fluid is called the object's Mach number. Objects moving at speeds greater than \"\"\"\" are said to be traveling at supersonic speeds. Sir Isaac Newton computed the speed of sound in air as , which is too low by about 15%.\n[5] Title: Wavelength Text:  For sound waves in air, the speed of sound is 343 m/s (at room temperature and atmospheric pressure). The wavelengths of sound frequencies audible to the human ear (20 Hz\u201320 kHz) are thus between approximately 17 m and 17 mm, respectively. Note that the wavelengths in audible sound are much longer than those in visible light. A standing wave is an undulatory motion that stays in one place. A sinusoidal standing wave includes stationary points of no motion, called nodes, and the wavelength is twice the distance between nodes.\nQuestion: the speed of sound wave in air depends on\nYour answer: ",

Attlee and the Labour leadership were sympathetic to the Congress movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. During the Second World War Attlee was in charge of Indian affairs. He set up the Cripps Mission in 1942, which tried and failed to bring the factions together. When the Congress called for passive resistance in the \"\"Quit India\"\" movement of 1942\u20131945, it was Attlee who ordered the arrest and internment for the duration of tens of thousands of Congress leaders and crushed the revolt.\n[2] Title: \"Quit India Movement\" Text:  Gandhi urged Jinnah against the celebration of this day, however, it was futile. At the Muslim League Lahore Session held in March 1940, Jinnah declared in his presidential address that the Muslims of the country wanted a separate homeland, Pakistan. In the meanwhile, crucial political events took place in England. Chamberlain was succeeded by Churchill as prime minister and the Conservatives, who assumed power in England, did not have a sympathetic stance towards the claims made by the Congress. In order to pacify the Indians in the circumstance of worsening war situation, the Conservatives were forced to concede some of the demands made by the Indians.\n[3] Title: \"British Raj\" Text:  Small warships were built, and an aircraft factory opened in Bangalore. The railway system, with 700,000 employees, was taxed to the limit as demand for transportation soared. The British government sent the Cripps' mission in 1942 to secure Indian nationalists' co-operation in the war effort in exchange for a promise of independence as soon as the war ended. Top officials in Britain, most notably Prime Minister Winston Churchill, did not support the Cripps Mission and negotiations with the Congress soon broke down. Congress launched the Quit India Movement in July 1942 demanding the immediate withdrawal of the British from India or face nationwide civil disobedience.\n[4] Title: \"Bengal famine of 1943\" Text:  British prime minister Winston Churchill responded to the new pressure through the Cripps' mission, broaching the post-war possibility of an autonomous political status for India in exchange for its full military support, but negotiations collapsed in early April 1942. On 8 August 1942 the Indian National Congress launched the Quit India movement, intended as a nationwide display of nonviolent resistance. The British authorities reacted by imprisoning the Congress leaders. Without its leadership, the movement changed its character and took to sabotaging factories, bridges, telegraph and railway lines, and other government property, thereby threatening the British Raj's war enterprise.\n[5] Title: \"Quit India Movement\" Text:  Many students paid more attention to Subhas Chandra Bose, who was in exile and supporting the Axis Powers. The only outside support came from the Americans, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressured Prime Minister Winston Churchill to give in to some of the Indian demands. The Quit India campaign was effectively crushed. The British refused to grant immediate independence, saying it could happen only after the war had ended. Sporadic small-scale violence took place around the country and the British arrested tens of thousands of leaders, keeping them imprisoned until 1945.\nQuestion: who was the prime minister of england during quit india movement\nYour answer: ",

On July 24, 2014, the park announced the construction of \"\"Thunderbird\"\", a launched Bolliger & Mabillard Wing Coaster, for the 2015 season, occupying the area north of Hyena Falls and intertwining with \"\"The Voyage\"\". This is B&M's first launched coaster (The Incredible Hulk Coaster at Universal's Islands of Adventure's launch was created by Universal, not B&M). The coaster reaches speeds up to in 3.5 seconds and the tallest vertical loop on a Wing Coaster.\n[2] Title: \"The Voyage (roller coaster)\" Text:  In 2014, Holiday World shortened the two trains from seven cars to six cars. In 2015, Thunderbird was opened, in the area around \"\"The Voyage\"\"'s third drop. To protect riders from being hit by loose articles, protective netting was installed over the track where \"\"The Voyage\"\" crosses under the exit from Thunderbird's vertical loop. \"\"The Voyage\"\"'s station is themed as a 17th-century ship, with the basement being the cargo hold, the second level being the deck, and the ride operator's controls being the \"\"Captain's Quarters\"\".\n[3] Title: \"The Incredible Hulk Coaster\" Text:  The launch system made The Incredible Hulk the only B&M ride to feature a launch, until Thunderbird opened at Holiday World in 2015. Unlike The Incredible Hulk, Thunderbird uses a Linear Synchronous Motors (LSM) launch system that was designed by B&M. Riders entered the science laboratory of Dr. Bruce Banner with many televisions showing the story of the Hulk. Bruce tries to find a way to reverse the effects, which the guests are about to take part in. While walking through the lab they encountered items including the generator, the gamma core and the towers of power.\n[4] Title: \"Bolliger & Mabillard\" Text:  In 2010, B&M unveiled its new Wing Coaster and premiered the prototype model, named \"\"Raptor\"\", at Gardaland in 2011. It has two seats on each side on the car that hang riders over the sides of the track. There are currently only eight in operation. In 2015, B&M constructed \"\"Thunderbird\"\" at Holiday World & Splashin' Safari, its first in-house launched coaster. By 2010, B&M employed twelve engineers, twelve draftsmen and two draftswomen.

In its place, the park planned on building Holidog's FunTown, a children's play area featuring a three-story play structure.

Joseph's father Jacob (also called Israel) favored him and gave Joseph the coat as a gift; as a result, he was envied by his brothers, who saw the special coat as an indication that Joseph would assume family leadership. His brothers' suspicion grew when Joseph told them of his two dreams (Genesis 37:11) in which all the brothers bowed down to him.\n[2] Title: \"Coat of many colors\" Text:  Coat of many colors In the Hebrew Bible, the coat of many colors ( \"\"ketonet passim\"\") is the name for the garment that Joseph owned, which was given to him by his father, Jacob. According to the King James Version, Genesis 37:3 reads, \"\"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.\"\" The Septuagint translation of the passage uses the word (\"\"poikilos\"\"), which indicates \"\"many colored\"\"; the Jewish Publication Society of America Version also employs the phrase \"\"coat of many colors\"\".\n[3] Title: \"Coat of many colors\" Text:  On the other hand, the Revised Standard Version translates \"\"ketonet passim\"\" as \"\"a long robe with sleeves\"\" while the New International Version notes the translation difficulties in a footnote, and translates it as \"\"a richly ornamented robe\"\". Aryeh Kaplan in \"\"The Living Torah\"\" gives a range of possible explanations: James Swanson suggests that the phrase indicates a \"\"tunic or robe unique in design for showing special favor or relationship\"\" and that \"\"either the robe was very long-sleeved and extending to the feet, or a richly-ornamented tunic either of special color design or gold threading, both ornamental and not suitable for working.\"\"\n[4] Title: Vayeshev Text:  Similarly, 2 Samuel reports that David's daughter Tamar had \"\"a garment of many colors\"\" (, \"\"ketonet pasim\"\"). explains that \"\"with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins appareled.\"\" As reports Joseph's half-brothers assaulted him, recounts that Tamar's half-brother Amnon assaulted her. And as reports that Joseph's coat was marred to make it appear that Joseph was torn in pieces, reports that Tamar's coat was torn. The parashah is discussed in these rabbinic sources from the era of the Mishnah and the Talmud: Rabbi Johanan taught that wherever Scripture uses the term \"\"And he abode\"\" (, \"\"vayeshev\"\"), as it does in it presages trouble.\n[5] Title: \"Coat of many colors\" Text:  Recent scholarship, especially among literary critics, has noted how the exhortation to \"\"identify\"\" and the theme of recognition in Genesis 37:32-33 also appears in 38:25-26, in the story of Judah and Tamar. This serves to connect the chapters and unify the narrative. Victor Hamilton calls these \"\"intentional literary parallels,\"\" while Robert Alter suggests that the verb \"\"identify\"\" plays \"\"a crucial thematic role in the d\u00e9nouement of the Joseph story when he confronts his brothers in Egypt, he recognizing them, they failing to recognize him.\"\"\nQuestion: who wore coat of many colors in bible\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Spleen Text:  The spleen is part of the lymphatic system. Both the short gastric arteries and the splenic artery supply it with blood. The germinal centers are supplied by arterioles called \"\"penicilliary radicles\"\". The spleen is unique in respect to its development within the gut. While most of the gut organs are endodermally derived (with the exception of the neural-crest derived adrenal gland), the spleen is derived from mesenchymal tissue. Specifically, the spleen forms within, and from, the dorsal mesentery. However, it still shares the same blood supply\u2014the celiac trunk\u2014as the foregut organs.\n[2] Title: Spleen Text:  Spleen The spleen is an organ found in virtually all vertebrates. Similar in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood filter. The word spleen comes . The spleen plays important roles in regard to red blood cells (erythrocytes) and the immune system. It removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood, which can be valuable in case of hemorrhagic shock, and also recycles iron. As a part of the mononuclear phagocyte system, it metabolizes hemoglobin removed from senescent red blood cells (erythrocytes).\n[3] Title: Spleen Text:  The spleen is a center of activity of the mononuclear phagocyte system and can be considered analogous to a large lymph node, as its absence causes a predisposition to certain infections. In humans the spleen is purple in color and is in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. The spleen is underneath the left part of the diaphragm, and has a smooth, convex surface that faces the diaphragm. It is underneath the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs. The other side of the spleen is divided by a ridge into two regions: an anterior gastric portion, and a posterior renal portion.\n[4] Title: \"Lymphatic system\" Text:  These monocytes, upon moving to injured tissue (such as the heart), turn into dendritic cells and macrophages while promoting tissue healing. The spleen is a center of activity of the mononuclear phagocyte system and can be considered analogous to a large lymph node, as its absence causes a predisposition to certain infections. Like the thymus, the spleen has only efferent lymphatic vessels. Both the short gastric arteries and the splenic artery supply it with blood. The germinal centers are supplied by arterioles called \"\"penicilliary radicles\"\".\n[5] Title: \"Lymphatic system\" Text:  Up to the fifth month of prenatal development the spleen creates red blood cells. After birth the bone marrow is solely responsible for hematopoiesis. As a major lymphoid organ and a central player in the reticuloendothelial system, the spleen retains the ability to produce lymphocytes. The spleen stores red blood cells and lymphocytes. It can store enough blood cells to help in an emergency. Up to 25% of lymphocytes can be stored at any one time. A lymph node is an organized collection of lymphoid tissue, through which the lymph passes on its way back to the blood.\nQuestion: the spleen is part of what system in the human body\nYour answer: ",

The first operational use took place on 23 October 1911, when Captain Carlo Piazza made a flight near Benghazi in a Bl\u00e9riot XI. The first aerial bombardment followed shortly afterwards on 1 November, when Second Lieutenant Giulio Gavotti dropped four bombs on two oases held by the Turks. The first photographic reconnaissance flight took place in March 1912, also flown by Captain Piazza. Some types developed during this period would see military service into, or even throughout, World War I.\n[2] Title: \"History of aerial warfare\" Text:  The first use of airplanes in an actual war occurred in the 1911 Italo-Turkish War with Italian Army Air Corps Bl\u00e9riot XI and Nieuport IV monoplanes bombing a Turkish camp at Ain Zara, Libya. In the First Balkan War (1912) the Bulgarian Air Force bombed Turkish positions at Adrianople, while the Greek Aviation performed, over the Dardanelles, the first naval air co-operation mission in history. Airplanes were also used by the United States Army against Pancho Villa. Air reconnaissance was carried out in both wars too. The air-dropped bomb was extensively used during the First Balkan War (including in the first night bombing on 7 November 1912), and subsequently used by the Imperial German Air Service during World War I.\n[3] Title: \"Industrial warfare\" Text:  The first use of airplanes in war was the Italo-Turkish War of 1911, when the Italians carried out several reconnaissance and bombing missions. During WWI both sides made use of balloons and airplanes for reconnaissance and directing artillery fire. To prevent enemy reconnaissance, some airplane pilots began attacking other airplanes and balloons, first with small arms carried in the cockpit, and later with machine guns mounted on the aircraft. Both sides also made use of aircraft for bombing, strafing and dropping of propaganda leaflets. The German air force carried out the first terror bombing raids, using Zeppelins to drop bombs on Britain.\n[4] Title: \"History of aviation\" Text:  The first mission (a reconnaissance) occurred on 23 October 1911. The first bombing mission was flown on 1 November 1911. Then Bulgaria followed this example. Its airplanes attacked and reconnoitered the Ottoman positions during the First Balkan War 1912\u201313. The first war to see major use of airplanes in offensive, defensive and reconnaissance capabilities was World War I. The Allies and Central Powers both used airplanes and airships extensively. While the concept of using the airplane as an offensive weapon was generally discounted before World War I, the idea of using it for photography was one that was not lost on any of the major forces.\n[5] Title: \"Military aviation\" Text:  The use of lighter-than-air aircraft in warfare became prevalent in the 19th century, including regular use in the American Civil War. Lighter-than-air military aviation persisted until shortly after World War II, gradually being withdrawn from various roles as heavier-than-air aircraft improved. Heavier-than-air aircraft were recognized as having military applications early on, despite resistance from traditionalists and the severe limitations of early aircraft. The U.S. Army Signal Corps purchased a Wright Model A on 2 August 1909 which became the first military aircraft in history. In 1911, the Italians used a variety of aircraft types in reconnaissance, photo-reconnaissance, and bombing roles during the Italo-Turkish War.\nQuestion: when was the first plane used in war\nYour answer: ",

The simplest sets of poker chips include white, red, and blue chips, with tradition dictating that the blues are highest in value. If a white chip is worth $1, a red is usually worth $5, and a blue $25. In 19th-century United States, there was enough of a tradition of using blue chips for higher values that \"\"blue chip\"\" in noun and adjective senses signaling high-value chips and high-value property are attested since 1873 and 1894, respectively.\n[2] Title: \"Casino token\" Text:  In 19th-century America, there was enough of a tradition of using blue chips for higher values that \"\"blue chip\"\" in noun and adjective senses signaling high-value chips and high-value property are attested since 1873 and 1894, respectively. This established connotation was first extended to the sense of a blue-chip stock in the 1920s. $2.50 chips (colloquially referred to as \"\"snappers\"\" by chip collectors) are mostly used for blackjack tables, since a \"\"natural\"\" (a 21 on the first two cards dealt to a player) typically pays 3:2 and most wagers are in increments of $5.\n[3] Title: \"Blue chip (stock market)\" Text:  This established connotation was first extended to the sense of a blue-chip stock in the 1920s. According to Dow Jones company folklore, this sense extension was coined by Oliver Gingold (an early employee of the company that would become Dow Jones) sometime in the 1920s, when Gingold was standing by the stock ticker at the brokerage firm that later became Merrill Lynch. Noticing several trades at $200 or $250 a share or more, he said to Lucien Hooper of stock brokerage W.E.

He had been on a hunger strike for more than a week, reportedly protesting the refusal by the authorities to allow him to seek medical treatment for injuries suffered as a result of torture. Mr. Mohammadi's attorney, Khalil Bahramian, said that according to fellow detainees of his client, he \"\"had been savagely beaten by prison guards in the past few days and that he was carrying the signs of the beatings\"\". Mohammadi's death caused an international outcry.\n[2] Title: \"Michael Devine (hunger striker)\" Text:  He was convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison. He joined the blanket protest before joining the hunger strike. Devine participated in a brief hunger strike in 1980, which was called off without fatalities. On 22 June 1981, Devine joined the 1981 hunger strike at the Maze Prison. He died on 20 August, the tenth and last of the hunger strikers to die. Michael Devine (hunger striker) Michael James \"\"Mickey\"\" Devine (26 May 1954\u201320 August 1981) was an Irish founding member of the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA).\n[3] Title: \"Martin Hurson\" Text:  He received concurrent sentences of twenty, fifteen and five years for these convictions. Hurson became engaged to his long-term girlfriend, Bernadette Donnelly, while in prison. He was part of the blanket protest and joined the 1981 hunger strike on 28 May, replacing Brendan McLaughlin who withdrew following a perforated stomach ulcer. He lost the ability to hold down water after around 40 days on hunger strike, and died of dehydration after only 46 days, considerably shorter than the others (the next shortest was Francis Hughes at 59 days).\n[4] Title: \"1981 Irish hunger strike\" Text:  Following a hunger strike, an IRA prisoner named Frank Stagg died in Wakefield Prison on 12 February 1976. The case brought international media attention as the Irish Government denied Stagg's last request for a military funeral march from Dublin to Ballina, and instead arranged for the police to bury him secretly. On 1 March 1976, Merlyn Rees, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the Wilson ministry, announced that those people convicted of causing terrorist offences would no longer be entitled to Special Category Status. The policy was not introduced for existing prisoners, but for those convicted of offences after 1 March 1976.\n[5] Title: \"Hunger strike\" Text:  Hundreds of others carried out shorter hunger strikes during the de Valera years with no sympathy from the Government. The tactic was revived by the Provisional IRA in the early 1970s, when several republicans such as Sean MacStiofain successfully used hunger strikes to get themselves released from custody without charge in the Republic of Ireland. Michael Gaughan died after being force-fed in a British prison in 1974.

It follows the story of country music singer Loretta Lynn, from her birth in a poor family and getting married at 15 to her rise as one of the most successful country musicians. Based on Lynn's 1976 biography of the same name by George Vecsey, the film stars Sissy Spacek as Lynn. Tommy Lee Jones, Beverly D'Angelo and Levon Helm are featured in supporting roles.\n[2] Title: \"Coal Miner's Daughter (film)\" Text:  For her performance, Spacek won an Academy Award, as well as \"\"Best Actress\"\" awards from the Golden Globes, the National Board of Review, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, the New York Film Critics Circle, and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle. Her co-star Beverly D'Angelo, who played Loretta's mentor, Patsy Cline, also chose to do her own singing rather than lip-synching; she was nominated for a Golden Globe, as was Tommy Lee Jones. Sissy Spacek's Best Actress Oscar win for playing Loretta Lynn created a rarity in the Academy's history in that the real-life Loretta Lynn was in the audience witnessing the victory.\n[3] Title: \"Loretta Lynn\" Text:  Because of her dominant hold on the 1970s, Lynn was named the \"\"Artist of the Decade\"\" by the Academy of Country Music. She is the only woman to win this honor. On March 5, 1980, the film \"\"Coal Miner's Daughter\"\" debuted in Nashville and soon became the No. 1 box office hit in the United States. Lynn crossed over from country music superstar to American legend. The film starred Sissy Spacek as Loretta and Tommy Lee Jones as Mooney Lynn. The film received seven Academy Award nominations, winning the Best Actress Oscar for Spacek and a slew of other top honors, including a gold album for the soundtrack album, a Grammy nomination for Spacek's singing as Lynn, Country Music Association and Academy of Country Music awards, plus several Golden Globe awards.\n[4] Title: \"Sissy Spacek\" Text:  Following her appearances in acclaimed films \"\"Welcome to L.A.\"\" (1976) and Robert Altman's \"\"3 Women\"\" (1977), she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Loretta Lynn in \"\"Coal Miner's Daughter\"\" (1980).

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Rotator cuff\" Text:  Rotator cuff In anatomy, the rotator cuff is a group of muscles and their tendons that act to stabilize the shoulder. Of the seven scapulohumeral muscles, four make up the rotator cuff. The four muscles are the supraspinatus muscle, the infraspinatus muscle, teres minor muscle, and the subscapularis muscle. The supraspinatus muscle spreads out in a horizontal band to insert on the superior and middle facets of the greater tubercle. The greater tubercle projects as the most lateral structure of the humeral head. Medial to this, in turn, is the lesser tuberosity of the humeral head.\n[2] Title: \"Rotator cuff\" Text:  The supraspinatus is most commonly involved in a rotator cuff tear. The rotator cuff muscles are important in shoulder movements and in maintaining glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) stability. These muscles arise from the scapula and connect to the head of the humerus, forming a cuff at the shoulder joint. They hold the head of the humerus in the small and shallow glenoid fossa of the scapula. The glenohumeral joint has been analogously described as a golf ball (head of the humerus) sitting on a golf tee (glenoid fossa).\n[3] Title: \"Rotator cuff\" Text:  The subscapularis muscle origin is divided from the remainder of the rotator cuff origins as it is deep to the scapula. The four tendons of these muscles converge to form the rotator cuff tendon. These tendinous insertions along with the articular capsule, the coracohumeral ligament, and the glenohumeral ligament complex, blend into a confluent sheet before insertion into the humeral tuberosities. The insertion site of the rotator cuff tendon at the greater tuberosity is often referred to as the footprint. The infraspinatus and teres minor fuse near their musculotendinous junctions, while the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons join as a sheath that surrounds the biceps tendon at the entrance of the bicipital groove.\n[4] Title: \"Greater tubercle\" Text:  The fourth muscle of the rotator cuff (the subscapularis) does not attach to the greater tubercle, but instead attaches to the lesser tubercle. Greater tubercle The greater tubercle of the humerus is situated lateral to the head of the humerus and posterolateral to the lesser tubercle. Its upper surface is rounded and marked by three flat impressions. The lateral surface of the greater tubercle is convex, rough, and continuous with the lateral surface of the body. Between the greater tubercle and the lesser tubercle is the bicipital groove (intertubercular sulcus).\n[5] Title: \"Greater tubercle\" Text:  Greater tubercle The greater tubercle of the humerus is situated lateral to the head of the humerus and posterolateral to the lesser tubercle.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Continental drift\" Text:  Alfred Wegener first presented his hypothesis to the German Geological Society on 6 January 1912. His hypothesis was that the continents had once formed a single landmass, called Pangaea, before breaking apart and drifting to their present locations. Wegener was the first to use the phrase \"\"continental drift\"\" (1912, 1915) (in German \"\"die Verschiebung der Kontinente\"\" \u2013 translated into English in 1922) and formally publish the hypothesis that the continents had somehow \"\"drifted\"\" apart. Although he presented much evidence for continental drift, he was unable to provide a convincing explanation for the physical processes which might have caused this drift.\n[2] Title: \"History of geology\" Text:  In 1912 Alfred Wegener proposed the theory of Continental Drift. This theory suggests that the shapes of continents and matching coastline geology between some continents indicates they were joined together in the past and formed a single landmass known as Pangaea; thereafter they separated and drifted like rafts over the ocean floor, currently reaching their present position. Additionally, the theory of continental drift offered a possible explanation as to the formation of mountains; Plate Tectonics built on the theory of continental drift. Unfortunately, Wegener provided no convincing mechanism for this drift, and his ideas were not generally accepted during his lifetime.\n[3] Title: Biogeography Text:  Moving on to the 20th century, Alfred Wegener introduced the Theory of Continental Drift in 1912, though it was not widely accepted until the 1960s. This theory was revolutionary because it changed the way that everyone thought about species and their distribution around the globe. The theory explained how continents were formerly joined together in one large landmass, Pangea, and slowly drifted apart due to the movement of the plates below Earth's surface. The evidence for this theory is in the geological similarities between varying locations around the globe, fossil comparisons from different continents, and the jigsaw puzzle shape of the landmasses on Earth.\n[4] Title: \"Abraham Ortelius\" Text:  This puzzle is made by Ravensburger, measures \u00d7 , and has over 18,000 pieces. Ortelius was the first to underline the geometrical similarity between the coasts of America and Europe-Africa, and to propose continental drift as an explanation. Kious described Ortelius's thoughts in this way: Ortelius's observations of continental juxtaposition and his proposal of rupture and separation were repeated by Alfred Wegener who published his hypothesis of continental drift in 1912 and in following years. Because his publications were widely available in German and English, and because he adduced geological support for the idea, Wegener is credited by most geologists as the first to recognize the possibility of continental drift.\n[5] Title: \"Continental drift\" Text:  Continental drift Continental drift is the theory that the Earth's continents have moved over geologic time relative to each other, thus appearing to have \"\"drifted\"\" across the ocean bed. The speculation that continents might have 'drifted' was first put forward by Abraham Ortelius in 1596. The concept was independently and more fully developed by Alfred Wegener in 1912, but his theory was rejected by many for lack of any motive mechanism. Arthur Holmes later proposed mantle convection for that mechanism. The idea of continental drift has since been subsumed by the theory of plate tectonics, which explains that the continents move by riding on plates of the Earth's lithosphere.\nQuestion: who proposed the first comprehensive theory of continental drift\nYour answer: ",

To coordinate operations, the Imperial General Headquarters, headed by the Emperor, was established in 1893.\n[2] Title: \"Empire of Japan (internal politics 1914\u20131944)\" Text:  Empire of Japan (internal politics 1914\u20131944) The political situation in Japan (1914\u201344) dealt with the realities of the two World Wars and their effect on Japanese national policy. Since the Meiji Period, Japan had been a constitutional monarchy. However, the name did not obscure the fact that Japan\u2019s form of government was more akin to an aristocratic oligarchy. In World War I, Japan fought alongside the Allied Powers. In 1915, Japan presented their Twenty-One Demands to China.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"History of Paris\" Text:  The king lived in the Tuileries Palace, while the regent lived in his family's luxurious Parisian residence, the Palais-Royal (the former Palais-Cardinal of Cardinal Richelieu). The regent devoted his attention to theater, opera, costume balls, and the courtesans of Paris. He made one important contribution to Paris intellectual life. In 1719, he moved the Royal library to the H\u00f4tel de Nevers near the Palais-Royal, where it eventually became part of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France (National Library of France). On 15 June 1722, distrustful of the turbulence in Paris, the regent moved the court back to Versailles; afterwards, Louis XV visited the city only on special occasions.\n[2] Title: \"Tuileries Palace\" Text:  The Tuileries Palace was virtually abandoned and used only as a theatre, but its gardens became a fashionable resort of Parisians. The boy-king Louis XV was moved from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace on 1 January 1716, four months after ascending to the throne. He moved back to Versailles on 15 June 1722, three months before his coronation. Both moves were made at the behest of the Regent, the duc d'Orl\u00e9ans. The king also resided at the Tuileries for short periods during the 1740s. On 6 October 1789, during the French Revolution, Louis XVI and his family were forced to leave Versailles and brought to the Tuileries where they were kept under surveillance.\n[3] Title: \"Louis XVIII of France\" Text:  On 16 July, the King's brother, the Count of Artois, left France with his wife and children, along with many other courtiers. Artois and his family took up residence in Turin, the capital city of his father-in-law's Kingdom of Sardinia, with the family of the Princes of Cond\u00e9. The Count of Provence decided to remain at Versailles. When the Royal Family plotted to abscond from Versailles to Metz, Provence advised the King not to leave, a suggestion he accepted. The Royal Family was forced to leave the palace at Versailles on the day after The Women's March on Versailles, 5 October 1789.\n[4] Title: \"Palace of Versailles\" Text:  Louis XIV died in 1715, and the young new King, Louis XV, just five years old, and his government were moved temporarily from Versailles to Paris under the regency of Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. In 1722, when the King came of age, he moved his residence and the government back to Versailles, where it remained until the French Revolution in 1789. Louis XV remained faithful to the original plan of his great-grandfather, and made few changes to the exteriors of Versailles. His main contributions were the construction of the Salon of Hercules, which connected the main building of the Palace with the north wing and the chapel (1724\u201336); and the royal opera theater, designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel, and built between 1769 and 1770.\n[5] Title: \"House of Orle\u0301ans\" Text:  The regent ruled France from his family residence in Paris, the Palais-Royal. He installed the young Louis XV in the Palais du Louvre which was opposite the Palais-Royal. In January 1723 Louis XV gained his majority and began to govern the country on his own. The young king moved the court back to Versailles and in December, Philippe II died and his son, Louis d'Orl\u00e9ans succeeded him as 3rd duke and, more importantly, as France's heir presumptive. Nonetheless, since his rank by birth (as a great-grandson of a French king) was \"\"prince du sang\"\", that of \"\"premier prince du sang\"\" constituted a higher style, of which he and his descendants henceforth made use.\nQuestion: where did the french king live before versailles\nYour answer: ",

Although the nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers, it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence.

Materiel support to Britain was provided while the U.S. was officially neutral via the Lend-Lease Act starting in 1941. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill in August 1941 promulgated the Atlantic Charter that pledged commitment to achieving \"\"the final destruction of Nazi tyranny\"\".

The fourth \"\"lac\"\" gene is \"\"lacI\"\", encoding the lactose repressor\u2014\"\"I\"\" stands for \"\"inducibility\"\". One may distinguish between \"\"structural\"\" genes encoding enzymes, and regulatory genes encoding proteins that affect gene expression. Current usage expands the phenotypic nomenclature to apply to proteins: thus, LacZ is the protein product of the \"\"lacZ\"\" gene, \u03b2-galactosidase.\n[2] Title: \"Lac operon\" Text:  The gene product of \"\"lacZ\"\" is \u03b2-galactosidase which cleaves lactose, a disaccharide, into glucose and galactose. \"\"lacY\"\" encodes Beta-galactoside permease, a membrane protein which becomes embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane to enable the cellular transport of lactose into the cell. Finally, \"\"lacA\"\" encodes Galactoside acetyltransferase. It would be wasteful to produce enzymes when no lactose were available or if a more preferable energy source such as glucose were available. The \"\"lac\"\" operon uses a two-part control mechanism to ensure that the cell expends energy producing the enzymes encoded by the \"\"lac\"\" operon only when necessary.\n[3] Title: \"Structural gene\" Text:  In prokaryotes, structural genes of related function are typically adjacent to one another on a single strand of DNA, forming an operon. This permits simpler regulation of gene expression, as a single regulatory factor can affect transcription of all associated genes. This is best illustrated by the well-studied \"\"lac\"\" operon, in which three structural genes (\"\"lacZ\"\", \"\"lacY\"\", and \"\"lacA\"\") are all regulated by a single promoter and a single operator. Prokaryotic structural genes are transcribed into a polycistronic mRNA and subsequently translated.\n[4] Title: \"Silencer (genetics)\" Text:  The three functional genes in this operon are lacZ, lacY, and lacA. The repressor gene, lacI, will produce the repressor protein LacI which is under allosteric regulation. These genes are activated by the presence of lactose in the cell which acts as an effector molecule that binds to LacI. When the repressor is bound to lactose, it will not bind to the operator, which allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter to initiate transcription of the operon. When the repressor's allosteric site is not bound to lactose, its active site will bind to the operator to prevent RNA polymerase from transcribing the genes of the \"\"lac\"\" operon.\n[5] Title: Operon Text:  The \"\"lac\"\" operon of the model bacterium \"\"Escherichia coli\"\" was the first operon to be discovered and provides a typical example of operon function. It consists of three adjacent structural genes, a promoter, a terminator, and an operator. The \"\"lac\"\" operon is regulated by several factors including the availability of glucose and lactose. It can be activated by allolactose. Lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription. This is an example of the derepressible (from above: negative inducible) model.\nQuestion: in prokaryotes the lac operon contains gene ( s ) for\nYour answer: ",

The conflict dragged on until a truce was declared on November 11, 1918, leading to the controversial, one-sided Treaty of Versailles, which was signed on June 28, 1919. The war's end triggered the abdication of various monarchies and the collapse of five of the last modern empires of Russia, Germany, China, Ottoman Turkey and Austria-Hungary, with the latter splintered into Austria, Hungary, southern Poland (who acquired most of their land in a war with Soviet Russia), Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, as well as the unification of Romania with Transylvania and Moldavia.\n[2] Title: \"World war\" Text:  World War I occurred from 1914 to 1918. In terms of human technological history, the scale of World War I was enabled by the technological advances of the second industrial revolution and the resulting globalization that allowed global power projection and mass production of military hardware. Wars on such a scale have not been repeated since the onset of the Atomic Age and the resulting danger of mutually-assured destruction. It had been recognized that the complex system of opposing alliances (the German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires against the British, Russian, and French Empires) was likely to lead to a worldwide conflict if a war broke out.\n[3] Title: \"British Armed Forces\" Text:  Dreadnoughts, torpedoes and submarines), and in 1906, Britain had determined that its only likely naval enemy was Germany. The accumulated tensions in European relations finally broke out into the hostilities of the First World War (1914\u20131918), in what is recognised today, as the most devastating war in British military history, with nearly 800,000 men killed and over 2 million wounded. Allied victory resulted in the defeat of the Central Powers, the end of the German Empire, the Treaty of Versailles and the establishment of the League of Nations.\n[4] Title: \"British Army\" Text:  By the first decade of the 20th century, the United Kingdom was allied with France (by the Entente Cordiale) and Russia (which had a secret agreement with France for mutual support in a war against the Prussian-led German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire). When the First World War broke out in August 1914 the British Army sent the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), consisting mainly of regular army troops, to France and Belgium. The fighting bogged down into static trench warfare for the remainder of the war. In 1915 the army created the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force to invade the Ottoman Empire via Gallipoli, an unsuccessful attempt to capture Constantinople and secure a sea route to Russia.\n[5] Title: \"Leslie Morshead\" Text:  When the First World War broke out in August 1914, Morshead resigned his teaching position and his commission in the Cadet Corps to travel to Sydney and enlist as a private in the 2nd Infantry Battalion of the First Australian Imperial Force. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in September. He landed at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, and his battalion made the farthest advance of any Australian unit that day. Invalided to Australia, he became commander of the 33rd Infantry Battalion, which he led on the Western Front at Messines, Passchendaele, Villers-Bretonneux, and Amiens.\nQuestion: when was the first world war broke out\nYour answer: ",

The Ohio River is formed by the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers at Point State Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. From there, it flows northwest through Allegheny and Beaver counties, before making an abrupt turn to the south-southwest at the West Virginia\u2013Ohio\u2013Pennsylvania triple-state line (near East Liverpool, Ohio; Chester, West Virginia; and Ohioville, Pennsylvania).

The Missouri River was one of the main routes for the watershed expansion of the United States during the 19th century. The Ohio River runs 981 miles (1582 km) long, starting at the meeting of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; ending in Cairo, Illinois, where it then flows into the Mississippi. The Ohio River flows through six states, including, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.\n[3] Title: \"Ohio River\" Text:  The river then follows a roughly southwest and then west-northwest course until Cincinnati, before bending to a west-southwest course for most of its length.

The Spanish \"\"company\"\" would be translated into Latin as \"\"societas\"\" like in \"\"socius\"\", a partner or comrade. From this came \"\"Society of Jesus\"\" (SJ) by which they would be known more widely.

The Society of Jesus is classified among institutes as a mendicant order of clerks regular, that is, a body of priests organized for apostolic work, following a religious rule, and relying on alms, or donations, for support. The term \"\"Jesuit\"\" (of 15th-century origin, meaning \"\"one who used too frequently or appropriated the name of Jesus\"\") was first applied to the society in reproach (1544\u201352).\n[3] Title: \"Society of Jesus\" Text:  Accordingly, the opening lines of the founding document declared that the society was founded for \"\"whoever desires to serve as a soldier of God to strive especially for the defence and propagation of the faith and for the progress of souls in Christian life and doctrine.\"\" Jesuits are thus sometimes referred to colloquially as \"\"God's soldiers\"\", \"\"God's marines\"\", or \"\"the Company\"\", which evolved from references to Ignatius' history as a soldier and the society's commitment to accepting orders anywhere and to endure any conditions.\n[4] Title: \"Society of Jesus\" Text:  Ignatius' six companions were: Francisco Xavier from Navarre (modern Spain), Alfonso Salmeron, Diego La\u00ednez, Nicol\u00e1s Bobadilla from Castile (modern Spain), Peter Faber from Savoy, and Sim\u00e3o Rodrigues from Portugal.

When built in 1989, it was the tallest, fastest, and steepest complete-circuit roller coaster in the world as well as the first hypercoaster \u2013 a roller coaster that exceeds in height. Some have credited Magnum with starting a period in the industry known as the \"\"roller coaster wars\"\", in which amusement parks competed with one another at a rapid pace to build the next tallest and fastest roller coaster.\n[2] Title: Hypercoaster Text:  The world's first hypercoaster was Magnum XL-200 by Cedar Point, costing $8,000,000 USD. Cedar Point chose Arrow Dynamics to design and construct Magnum XL-200. Construction on Magnum XL-200 began in 1988, and the ride opened on May 6, 1989. Since its debut, Magnum XL-200 has served more than 36 million guests. Cedar Point's official blog states that after building the ride, \"\"discussion was focused on just what a roller coaster such as Magnum should be called. After all, it had no loops like most of the other large steel coasters of the time and was so much bigger and faster than its non-looping brethren.\n[3] Title: \"Magnum XL-200\" Text:  Following its completion in 1989, Kinzel was one of the first people to ride the coaster, boarding the train after one test cycle. It officially opened to the public on May 6, 1989 as the world's tallest, fastest and steepest complete-circuit roller coaster. It was measured for the Guinness Book of World Records on June 2. Cedar Point set a record attendance in 1989, due in part to the introduction of the Magnum. Magnum was awarded the ACE Roller Coaster Landmark award on June 21, 2004. Magnum has been repainted once in its history.\n[4] Title: \"Cedar Point\" Text:  In 1988, Soak City (now known as Cedar Point Shores), Cedar Point's outdoor water park, was constructed near Hotel Breakers. It featured speed slides, more than 10 body and tube slides, a family raft ride, a water playhouse and two lazy rivers. Several new rides and roller coasters opened at Cedar Point from 1989 to 2011 that were record-breakers. Magnum XL-200 debuted in 1989, breaking the world height and speed records. It was the first roller coaster to exceed a height of and speeds over and was the first hypercoaster in the world.\n[5] Title: \"Magnum XL-200\" Text:  Magnum XL-200 was designated an ACE Roller Coaster Landmark on June 21, 2004, at the 27th Annual Convention of the American Coaster Enthusiasts.

In the men's Division I, the lowest-seeded team ever to reach this round in the modern 64 team tournament era was #12 Missouri in 2002, who upset #5-seed Miami (Florida), #4-seed Ohio State, and #8-seed UCLA before losing to #2-seed Oklahoma in the West regional that year. Eight #11 seeds have advanced to the Elite Eight: LSU in 1986, Loyola Marymount in 1990, Temple in 2001, George Mason in 2006, Virginia Commonwealth in 2011, Dayton in 2014, Xavier in 2017, and Loyola Chicago in 2018.\n[2] Title: \"Dale Brown (basketball)\" Text:  In spite of all these troubles, LSU jumped out to a 14\u20130 start, and finished with a 22\u201311 record. LSU made it into the 1986 NCAA tournament as an 11-seed. Some people were critical of the inclusion, arguing that a slumping team with 11 losses did not deserve an at-large bid. But thanks in part to an unusual, confusing defense Brown devised, which he called the \"\"Freak Defense,\"\" the Tigers overcame their lack of talent and depth to make an unlikely run. Also to LSU's advantage was that their 1st and 2nd round games were played on their home floor (a practice that the NCAA no longer allows due to the significant advantage it can give).\n[3] Title: \"University of Dayton\" Text:  The men's basketball team reached the 1967 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship final game and won the National Invitational Tournament in 1962, 1968, and 2010. In 2014, the men's basketball Flyers made it to the NCAA Elite Eight after upsetting sixth-seeded Ohio State, third-seeded Syracuse, and 10th-seeded Stanford. The football team won NCAA Division III national titles in 1980 and 1989 and finished runner-up in 1981, 1987, and 1991. The Sports Network also named the Flyers football squad the nation's top Football Championship Subdivision mid-major program in 2007.\n[4] Title: \"NC State Wolfpack men's basketball\" Text:  The Pack reached the Elite Eight in 1985 and 1986 and the Sweet Sixteen in 1989. In 1987, after a sixth-place finish in the regular season, NC State made another surprising run through the ACC Tournament. In the championship game, State defeated rival North Carolina, which had gone undefeated in conference play. It was the program's last ACC championship to date. State finished second in the conference the following year and was a #3 seed in the NCAA Tournament. The team made an early exit, though, losing to #14 seed Murray State in the first round.\n[5] Title: \"Utah Utes men's basketball\" Text:  Unlike the last time these two teams met in the NCAA Tournament, Utah cruised to an 85\u201368 victory. In the second round they faced Arkansas and pulled out a 75\u201369 victory to advance to the school's third straight Sweet 16, where they defeated West Virginia 65\u201362, giving the Utes a second straight trip to the Elite Eight. Reaching the Elite Eight for the second time in a row was a feat in and of itself.

It is the most densely populated and southernmost region in Canada. The exact northern boundary of Southern Ontario is disputed, however the core region is situated south of Algonquin Park, the latter being in an area of transition between coniferous forest north of the French and Mattawa Rivers and southern deciduous forest. It covers between 14 and 15% of the province, depending on the inclusion of the Parry Sound and Muskoka districts which also lie in the transitional area between northern and southern forest regions.\n[3] Title: \"Southern Ontario\" Text:  With more than 12.7 million people, the region is home to approximately one-third of Canada's population of 35.1 million.

It is broken into smaller subregions, including Central Ontario, Georgian Triangle, Southwestern Ontario, the Golden Horseshoe, and Eastern Ontario. The core area of Southern Ontario is part of the Quebec City\u2013Windsor Corridor, which extends northeast into southern Quebec.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Tower Bridge\" Text:  Tower Bridge Tower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London built between 1886 and 1894. The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and has become an iconic symbol of London. Because of this, Tower Bridge is sometimes confused with London Bridge, situated some upstream. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges now owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. It is the only one of the Trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in Tower Hamlets.\n[2] Title: \"Tower Bridge\" Text:  The total cost of construction was \u00a31,184,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in ). The bridge was officially opened on 30 June 1894 by the then Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII), and his wife, The Princess of Wales (Alexandra of Denmark). The bridge connected Iron Gate, on the north bank of the river, with Lane, on the south \u2013 now known as Tower Bridge Approach and Tower Bridge Road, respectively. Until the bridge was opened, the Tower Subway \u2013 400 m to the west \u2013 was the shortest way to cross the river from Tower Hill to Tooley Street in Southwark.\n[3] Title: \"William Arrol\" Text:  Other notable bridges followed, including: Tower Bridge in London, completed in 1894. Construction started in 1886 and took eight years with five major contractors Sir John Jackson (foundations), Baron Armstrong (hydraulics), William Webster, Sir H.H. Bartlett, and Sir William Arrol & Co.. It employed 432 construction workers. E W Crutwell was the resident engineer for the construction. Two massive piers, containing over 70,000 tons of concrete, were sunk into the river bed to support the construction. Over 11,000 tons of steel provided the framework for the towers and walkways.\n[4] Title: \"Tower Bridge\" Text:  E W Crutwell was the resident engineer for the construction. Two massive piers, containing over 70,000 tons of concrete, were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction. Over 11,000 tons of steel provided the framework for the towers and walkways. This was then clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone, both to protect the underlying steelwork and to give the bridge a pleasing appearance. Jones died in 1886 and George D. Stevenson took over the project. Stevenson replaced Jones's original brick fa\u00e7ade with the more ornate Victorian Gothic style, which makes the bridge a distinctive landmark, and was intended to harmonise the bridge with the nearby Tower of London.\n[5] Title: \"Tower Bridge\" Text:  Over 50 designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette. Bazalgette's design was rejected because of a lack of sufficient headroom, and design was not approved until 1884, when it was decided to build a bascule bridge. Sir John Wolfe Barry was appointed engineer with Sir Horace Jones as architect (who was also one of the judges). An Act of Parliament was passed in 1885 authorising the bridge's construction. It specified the opening span must give a clear width of and a headroom of . Construction had to be in a Gothic style.\nQuestion: when was the tower bridge in london built\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Self-esteem Text:  Self-esteem Self-esteem reflects an individual's overall subjective emotional evaluation of their own worth. It is the decision made by an individual as an attitude towards the self. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs about oneself, (for example, \"\"I am competent\"\", \"\"I am worthy\"\"), as well as emotional states, such as triumph, despair, pride, and shame. Smith and Mackie (2007) defined it by saying \"\"The self-concept is what we think about the self; self-esteem, is the positive or negative evaluations of the self, as in how we feel about it.\"\"\n[2] Title: \"Sequential bilingualism\" Text:  Self-belief comprises two components: Self-efficacy beliefs and self-concept beliefs. The former refers to one\u2019s own belief as to whether he or she is capable of performing a given learning task and are consequently future-oriented; whereas the latter involves evaluations of one\u2019s general self-worth based on past experiences. It is said that low self-efficacy beliefs would pose as an obstacle in language learning because it indicates a lack of self-confidence and thus reduces the motivation to learn. L1 interference in bilingual language acquisition generally refers to the influence that the learner\u2019s L1 exerts over the acquisition of an L2.\n[3] Title: Self-assessment Text:  Unlike the other two motives through self-assessment people are interested in the accuracy of their current self view, rather than improving their self-view. This makes self-assessment the only self-evaluative motive that may cause a person's self-esteem to be damaged. In educational psychology and education, self-assessment \"\"involves a wide variety of mechanisms and techniques through which students describe (i.e., assess) and possibly assign merit or worth to (i.e., evaluate) the qualities of their own learning processes and products\"\" (Panadero, Brown & Strijbos, 2016 p. 804).\n[4] Title: Self-assessment Text:  Self-assessment In social psychology, self-assessment is the process of looking at oneself in order to assess aspects that are important to one's identity. It is one of the motives that drive self-evaluation, along with self-verification and self-enhancement. Sedikides (1993) suggests that the self-assessment motive will prompt people to seek information to confirm their uncertain self-concept rather than their certain self-concept and at the same time people use self-assessment to enhance their certainty of their own self-knowledge. However, the self-assessment motive could be seen as quite different from the other two self-evaluation motives.\n[5] Title: \"Social psychology\" Text:  Leon Festinger's 1954 social comparison theory is that people evaluate their own abilities and opinions by comparing themselves to others when they are uncertain of their own ability or opinions. There is also the facial feedback hypothesis: that changes in facial expression can lead to corresponding changes in emotion. The fields of social psychology and personality have merged over the years, and social psychologists have developed an interest in self-related phenomena. In contrast with traditional personality theory, however, social psychologists place a greater emphasis on cognitions than on traits. Much research focuses on the self-concept, which is a person's understanding of their self.\nQuestion: a person 's evaluation about his or her own worthiness is called\nYour answer: ",

Agriculture accounted for 23% of GDP, and employed 59% of the country's total workforce in 2016. As the Indian economy has diversified and grown, agriculture's contribution to GDP has steadily declined from 1951 to 2011, yet it is still the country's largest employment source and a significant piece of its overall socio-economic development. Crop-yield-per-unit-area of all crops has grown since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements in irrigation, technology, application of modern agricultural practices and provision of agricultural credit and subsidies since the Green Revolution in India.\n[2] Title: \"Agriculture in India\" Text:  Agriculture in India The history of Agriculture in India dates back to Indus Valley Civilization Era and even before that in some parts of Southern India. India ranks second worldwide in farm outputs. Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry and fisheries accounted for 15.4% of the GDP (gross domestic product) in 2016 with about 31% of the workforce in 2014. India ranks first globally with highest net cropped area followed by US and China. The economic contribution of agriculture to India's GDP is steadily declining with the country's broad-based economic growth.\n[3] Title: \"Agriculture in India\" Text:  India's agricultural economy is undergoing structural changes. Between 1970 and 2011, the GDP share of agriculture has fallen from 43% to 16%. This isn't because of reduced importance of agriculture or a consequence of agricultural policy. This is largely because of the rapid economic growth in services, industrial output, and non-agricultural sectors in India between 2000 and 2010. Agricultural scientist MS Swaminathan has played a vital role in the green revolution. In 2013 NDTV awarded him as 25 living legend of India for outstanding contribution to agriculture and making India a food sovereign country.\n[4] Title: \"Agriculture in India\" Text:  In 2010, only about 35% of agricultural land in India was reliably irrigated. About 2/3rd cultivated land in India is dependent on monsoons. The improvements in irrigation infrastructure in the last 50 years have helped India improve food security, reduce dependence on monsoons, improve agricultural productivity and create rural job opportunities. Dams used for irrigation projects have helped provide drinking water to a growing rural population, control flood and prevent drought-related damage to agriculture. , India had a large and diverse agricultural sector, accounting, on average, for about 16% of GDP and 10% of export earnings.\n[5] Title: \"Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare\" Text:  Agriculture provides the bulk of wage goods required by non-agriculture sectors and most of the raw materials for the industries sector. India is a largely agrarian economy - with 52.1% of the population estimated to directly or indirectly employed in agriculture and allied sectors in 2009-10. The combined efforts of Central Government, State Governments and the farming community have succeeded in achieving record production of 244.78 million tonnes of foodgrains during 2010-11.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"S phase\" Text:  S phase S phase (Synthesis Phase) is the phase of the cell cycle in which DNA is replicated, occurring between G phase and G phase. Since accurate duplication of the genome is critical to successful cell division, the processes that occur during S-phase are tightly regulated and widely conserved. Entry into S-phase is controlled by the G1 restriction point (R), which commits cells to the remainder of the cell-cycle if there is adequate nutrients and growth signaling. This transition is essentially irreversible; after passing the restriction point, the cell will progress through S-phase even if environmental conditions become unfavorable.\n[2] Title: \"DNA replication\" Text:  \"\"E. coli\"\" regulates this process through the use of termination sequences that, when bound by the Tus protein, enable only one direction of replication fork to pass through. As a result, the replication forks are constrained to always meet within the termination region of the chromosome. Within eukaryotes, DNA replication is controlled within the context of the cell cycle. As the cell grows and divides, it progresses through stages in the cell cycle; DNA replication takes place during the S phase (synthesis phase). The progress of the eukaryotic cell through the cycle is controlled by cell cycle checkpoints.\n[3] Title: \"Central dogma of molecular biology\" Text:  A complex group of proteins called the replisome performs the replication of the information from the parent strand to the complementary daughter strand. The replisome comprises: This process typically takes place during S phase of the cell cycle. Transcription is the process by which the information contained in a section of DNA is replicated in the form of a newly assembled piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). Enzymes facilitating the process include RNA polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryotic cells the primary transcript is pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA must be processed for translation to proceed.\n[4] Title: \"Eukaryotic DNA replication\" Text:  In G phase of the cell cycle, many of the DNA replication regulatory processes are initiated. In eukaryotes, the vast majority of DNA synthesis occurs during S phase of the cell cycle, and the entire genome must be unwound and duplicated to form two daughter copies. During G, any damaged DNA or replication errors are corrected. Finally, one copy of the genomes is segregated to each daughter cell at mitosis or M phase. These daughter copies each contain one strand from the parental duplex DNA and one nascent antiparallel strand.\n[5] Title: \"Eukaryotic DNA replication\" Text:  During the G stage of the cell cycle, the replication initiation factors, origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1, and minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) protein complex, bind sequentially to DNA to form the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). At the transition of the G stage to the S phase of the cell cycle, S phase\u2013specific cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) and Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase (DDK) transform the pre-RC into an active replication fork. During this transformation, the pre-RC is disassembled with the loss of Cdc6, creating the initiation complex.\nQuestion: during which stage of the cell cycle does the replication of dna take place\nYour answer: ",

It was a siege operation, starting sometime in 149 or 148 BC, and ending in spring 146 BC with the sack and complete destruction of the city of Carthage. After a Roman army under Manius Manilius landed in Africa in 149 BC, Carthage surrendered and handed over hostages and arms. The Romans demanded the complete surrender of the city and surprisingly to the Romans, the city refused, the faction advocating submission overturned by one in favor of defense.\n[2] Title: \"Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)\" Text:  In the words of Polybius: Since the 19th Century, various historians have claimed that the Romans ploughed over the city and sowed salt into the soil after destroying it but this is not supported by ancient sources. Certain scholars, including Professor of History Ben Kiernan, allege that this total destruction of Carthage may have accounted to modern views of genocide. Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC) The Battle of Carthage was the main engagement of the Third Punic War between the Punic city of Carthage in Africa and the Roman Republic.\n[3] Title: \"Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)\" Text:  In the spring of 146 BC, Scipio and the Roman troops seized the Cothon wall in Carthage. When daylight broke, 4,000 fresh Roman troops led by Scipio attacked Byrsa, the strongest part of the city. Three streets lined with six story houses led to the Byrsa fortress and Carthaginians and Romans fought from the rooftops of the buildings and in the streets. The Romans used captured buildings to capture other buildings. Scipio captured Byrsa and then set fire to the buildings, which caused further destruction and death. This fighting waged for six days and nights, until the Carthaginians surrendered.\n[4] Title: \"Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)\" Text:  An estimated 50,000 surviving inhabitants were sold into slavery and the city was then levelled. The land surrounding Carthage was eventually declared \"\"ager publicus\"\" (public land) and was shared between local farmers and Roman and Italian colonists. During the battle, 900 survivors, most of them Roman deserters, had found refuge in the temple of Eshmun, in the citadel of Byrsa, although it was already burning. They tried to negotiate a surrender but Scipio Aemilianus declared that forgiveness was impossible either for Hasdrubal, the general who defended the city or for the defectors.\n[5] Title: \"Punic Wars\" Text:  While fighting Hannibal in Italy, Hispania, and Sicily, Rome simultaneously fought against Macedon in the First Macedonian War. Eventually, the war was taken to Africa, where Carthage was defeated at the Battle of Zama (201 BC) by Scipio Africanus. The end of the war saw Carthage's control reduced to only the city itself. There were three military theaters in this war: Italy, where Hannibal defeated the Roman legions repeatedly; Hispania, where Hasdrubal, a younger brother of Hannibal, defended the Carthaginian colonial cities with mixed success until eventually retreating into Italy; and Sicily, where the Romans held military supremacy.\nQuestion: where did the battle of carthage take place\nYour answer: ",

As a demo, \"\"No Matter What\"\" was originally recorded by Ham on acoustic guitar and performed with a mambo beat (as heard on the posthumous Ham solo CD \"\"7 Park Avenue\"\"). A similar sound to the original demo can be heard on an album track from their next album \"\"Straight Up\"\" called \"\"Perfection\"\".\n[2] Title: \"No Matter What (Badfinger song)\" Text:  The song is notable for being one of the first successful records associated with the power pop sound, using all of the elements attributed to the genre. A subsequent single released by Badfinger, \"\"Baby Blue\"\" (Billboard number 14, 1972), along with several album tracks in a similar vein, succeeded in categorising the band themselves as power pop.

The song was recorded again by the band in April 1970 at Abbey Road Studios and it was this version that would appear on the album and single. Although the song and recording was a favourite of Badfinger's shortly after it was recorded, the hierarchy at Apple reportedly was not inclined to release it in any format. It was not until Al Steckler, the American director of Apple in New York, heard the tape in the summer of 1970 and considered it a strong entry by the band that it was slotted for the upcoming LP and as a single release.\n[4] Title: \"Mal Evans\" Text:  In 1968, Evans had seen the group Badfinger (then known as The Iveys) play live, and suggested that they be signed to Apple. Evans then produced several of their songs in 1969 and 1970, the most notable of which was \"\"No Matter What\"\", which charted on Billboard's Top 10 in December 1970. Evans also discovered the group Splinter and brought them to the Apple label, although they would subsequently move to George Harrison's Dark Horse Records. Evans' other production credits include Jackie Lomax' 1969 single \"\"New Day\"\" (on Apple) and some of the tracks on Keith Moon's only solo album \"\"Two Sides of the Moon\"\" (1975).\n[5] Title: \"No Dice\" Text:  In October 1991, \"\"No Dice\"\" was digitally remastered at Abbey Road Studio by Ron Furmanek. The remastered album was released in 1992 by Capitol Records and Apple, with five previously unreleased bonus tracks. Of the bonus tracks, \"\"Friends Are Hard to Find\"\" was an outtake from the same Mal Evans-produced session that saw the recording of \"\"No Matter What\"\" and \"\"Believe Me\"\". \"\"Get Down\"\" was originally attempted with Evans but the version here was recorded with Geoff Emerick.\nQuestion: who wrote no matter what by ryan stevenson\nYour answer: ",

In 1994, a walkthrough attraction at Disneyland Paris, named Les Myst\u00e8res du Nautilus, opened, and a dark ride at Tokyo DisneySea was created in 2001.\n[4] Title: \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: Submarine Voyage\" Text:  Eight submarines painted in grey took guests through the attraction, which took place in a lagoon visible from Tomorrowland and a large show building hidden behind two waterfalls. It became extremely popular with guests, and Walt Disney Imagineering consequently planned for more elaborate version for the forthcoming Florida Project concept, which would become Walt Disney World. One of the signature pieces of 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea was the fleet of passenger vehicles, adapted for theme park use from Harper Goff's Nautilus design for the 1954 Disney live-action version by Disney Imagineer George McGinnis.\n[5] Title: \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: Submarine Voyage\" Text:  The basic hulls were constructed by Morgan Yachts in Clearwater, Florida, with the final building work being transferred to Tampa Ship midway through. Another veteran Imagineer, Bob Gurr, oversaw the project. Upon delivery at Walt Disney World in August 1971, the vehicles weighed some forty tons, and were installed into a concrete guide (track), mounted on top of a mechanism that limited \"\"bumping\"\" accidents. The attraction vehicles were not actual submarines, but instead boats in which the guests sat below water level.\nQuestion: when did 20000 leagues under the sea close at disney world\nYour answer: ",

It is often called the 'National Poem of India'. The poem was published in the weekly journal \"\"Ittehad\"\" on 16 August 1904. Publicly recited by Iqbal the following year at Government College, Lahore, British India (now in Pakistan) it quickly became an anthem of opposition to the British Raj.\n[2] Title: \"Sare Jahan se Accha\" Text:  The song, an ode to Hindustan\u2014the land comprising present-day Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, was later published in 1924 in the Urdu book Bang-i-Dara. The song has remained popular, especially in India. An abridged version is sung and played frequently as a patriotic song and as a marching song of the Indian Armed Forces. A satirical version of the same from a 1958 Hindi movie also remains popular. Its popular fast tempo tune was composed by Pandit Ravi Shankar in 1945 based on raga Mishra Pilu, and it was set as a marching tune by Professor Antsher Lobo.\n[3] Title: \"Ravi Shankar\" Text:  He often studied with Khan's children Ali Akbar Khan and Annapurna Devi. Shankar began to perform publicly on \"\"sitar\"\" in December 1939 and his debut performance was a \"\"jugalbandi\"\" (duet) with Ali Akbar Khan, who played the string instrument \"\"sarod\"\". Shankar completed his training in 1944. He moved to Mumbai and joined the Indian People's Theatre Association, for whom he composed music for ballets in 1945 and 1946. Shankar recomposed the music for the popular song \"\"Sare Jahan Se Achcha\"\" at the age of 25.\n[4] Title: \"Sare Jahan se Accha\" Text:  Later that year he left for Europe for a three-year sojourn that was to transform him into an Islamic philosopher and a visionary of a future Islamic society. In 1910, Iqbal wrote another song for children, \"\"Tarana-e-Milli\"\" (Anthem of the Religious Community), which was composed in the same metre and rhyme scheme as \"\"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\"\", but which renounced much of the sentiment of the earlier song. The sixth stanza of \"\"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\"\" (1904), which is often quoted as proof of Iqbal's secular outlook: contrasted significantly with the first stanza of \"\"Tarana-e-Milli\"\" (1910) reads: Iqbal's world view had now changed; it had become both global and Islamic.\n[5] Title: \"Sare Jahan se Accha\" Text:  Iqbal! We have no confidant in this world<br> What does any one know of our hidden pain? Iqbal was a lecturer at the Government College, Lahore at that time, and was invited by a student Lala Har Dayal to preside over a function. Instead of delivering a speech, Iqbal sang \"\"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\"\". The song, in addition to embodying yearning and attachment to the land of Hindustan, expressed \"\"cultural memory\"\" and had an elegiac quality. In 1905, the 27-year-old Iqbal viewed the future society of the subcontinent as both a pluralistic and composite Hindu-Muslim culture.\nQuestion: who composed famous song sare jahan se acha\nYour answer: ",

Harrison suggested the idea of a guitar solo in the track, Lennon decided they should trade solos and McCartney elected to go first.\n[3] Title: \"Abbey Road\" Text:  The basic track was recorded on 7 July 1969. Harrison sang lead and played acoustic guitar, McCartney provided backing vocals and played bass and Starr played the drums. Lennon was still recuperating from his car accident and did not perform on the track. Martin provided an orchestral arrangement in collaboration with Harrison, who overdubbed a Moog synthesizer part on 19 August, immediately before the final mix.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Vein Text:  When a vein is drained of blood and removed from an organism, it appears grey-white. The largest veins in the human body are the venae cavae. These are two large veins which enter the right atrium of the heart from above and below. The superior vena cava carries blood from the arms and head to the right atrium of the heart, while the inferior vena cava carries blood from the legs and abdomen to the heart. The inferior vena cava is retroperitoneal and runs to the right and roughly parallel to the abdominal aorta along the spine.\n[2] Title: \"Human body\" Text:  These collect in progressively larger veins until they reach the body's two largest veins, the superior and inferior vena cava, which drain blood into the right side of the heart. From here, the blood is pumped into the lungs where it receives oxygen and drains back into the left side of the heart. From here, it is pumped into the body's largest artery, the aorta, and then progressively smaller arteries and arterioles until it reaches tissue. Here blood passes from small arteries into capillaries, then small veins and the process begins again.\n[3] Title: Vein Text:  The precise location of veins varies much more from person to person than that of arteries. Veins serve to return blood from organs to the heart. Veins are also called \"\"capacitance vessels\"\" because most of the blood volume (60%) is contained within veins. In systemic circulation oxygenated blood is pumped by the left ventricle through the arteries to the muscles and organs of the body, where its nutrients and gases are exchanged at capillaries. After taking up cellular waste and carbon dioxide in capillaries, blood is channeled through vessels that converge with one another to form venules, which continue to converge and form the larger veins.\n[4] Title: \"Cephalic vein\" Text:  Cephalic vein In human anatomy, the cephalic vein is a superficial vein in the arm. It communicates with the basilic vein via the median cubital vein at the elbow and is located in the superficial fascia along the anterolateral surface of the biceps brachii muscle. Near the shoulder, the cephalic vein passes between the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles (deltopectoral groove) and through the deltopectoral triangle, where it empties into the axillary vein. The cephalic vein is often visible through the skin, and its location in the deltopectoral groove is fairly consistent, making this site a good candidate for venous access.\n[5] Title: \"Axillary vein\" Text:  Axillary vein In human anatomy, the axillary vein is a large blood vessel that conveys blood from the lateral aspect of the thorax, axilla (armpit) and upper limb toward the heart. There is one axillary vein on each side of the body. Its origin is at the lower margin of the teres major muscle and a continuation of the brachial vein. This large vein is formed by the brachial vein and the basilic vein. At its terminal part, it is also joined by the cephalic vein. Other tributaries include the subscapular vein, circumflex humeral vein, lateral thoracic vein and thoraco-acromial vein.\nQuestion: where are veins located in the human body\nYour answer: ",

Michael Cimino was initially slated to direct \"\"Pope\"\". After Rourke and Roberts signed on as the leads, Cimino wanted to finesse the screenplay with some rewriting and restructuring. However, the rewriting would have taken Cimino beyond the mandated start date for shooting, so Cimino and MGM parted ways. Roger Ebert of the \"\"Chicago Sun-Times\"\" gave the film three stars, saying, \"\"It's worth seeing for the acting, and it's got some good laughs in it, and New York is colorfully observed, but don't tell me this movie is about human nature, because it's not; it's about acting.\"\"\n[3] Title: \"Heat (1995 film)\" Text:  The network was unhappy with Plank as the lead actor, and asked Mann to recast Hanna's role. Mann declined and the show was cancelled and the pilot aired on August 27, 1989 as a television film entitled \"\"L.A. Takedown\"\". which was later released on VHS and DVD in Europe. In April 1994, Mann was reported to have abandoned his earlier plan to shoot a biopic of James Dean in favor of directing \"\"Heat\"\", producing it with Art Linson. The film was marketed as the first on-screen appearance of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro together in the same scene \u2013 both actors had previously starred in \"\"The Godfather Part II\"\", but owing to the nature of their roles, they were never seen in the same scene.\n[4] Title: \"Al Pacino\" Text:  \"\"88 Minutes\"\" was released on April 18, 2008, in the United States, after having been released in various other countries in 2007.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Rebar Text:  The carcass of the tower was connected to its cast iron tented roof, crowned with one of the first known lightning rods. However, it was not until the mid-19th century that rebar displayed its greatest strengths with the embedding of steel bars into concrete, thus producing modern reinforced concrete. Several people in Europe and North America developed reinforced concrete in the 1850s. These include Joseph-Louis Lambot of France, who built reinforced concrete boats in Paris (1854) and Thaddeus Hyatt of the United States, who produced and tested reinforced concrete beams.\n[2] Title: Rebar Text:  Joseph Monier of France is one of the most notable figures for the invention and popularization of reinforced concrete. As a French gardener, Monier patented reinforced concrete flower pots in 1867, before proceeding to build reinforced concrete water tanks and bridges. Ernest L. Ransome, an English engineer and architect who worked in the United States, made a significant contribution to the development of reinforcing bars in concrete construction. He invented twisted iron rebar, which he initially thought of while designing self-supporting sidewalks for the Masonic Hall in Stockton, California. His twisted rebar was, however, not initially appreciated and even ridiculed at the Technical Society of California, where members stated that the twisting would weaken the iron.\n[3] Title: Rebar Text:  In 1889, Ransome worked on the West Coast mainly designing bridges. One of these, the Alvord Lake Bridge in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, was the first reinforced concrete bridge built in the United States. He used twisted rebar in this structure. At the same time Ernest L. Ransome was inventing twisted steel rebar, C.A.P. Turner was designing his \"\"mushroom system\"\" of reinforced concrete floor slabs with smooth round rods and Julius Kahn (inventor) was experimenting with an innovative rolled diamond-shaped rebar with flat-plate flanges angled upwards at 45\u00b0 (patented in 1902).\n[4] Title: Rebar Text:  Steel and concrete have similar coefficients of thermal expansion, so a concrete structural member reinforced with steel will experience minimal stress as the temperature changes. Reinforcing bars in masonry construction have been used since at least the 15th century (2,500 meters of rebar was used in the Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes). During the 18th century, rebar was used to form the carcass of the Leaning Tower of Nevyansk in Russia, built on the orders of the industrialist Akinfiy Demidov. The cast iron used for the rebar was of high quality, and there is no corrosion on the bars to this day.\n[5] Title: Rastra Text:  After the blocks are trimmed to exact size, the remaining debris is recycled to create new blocks. No byproducts are released in the production process that are considered a burden to the environment. Rastra blocks come in different sizes, and can be easily cut with woodworking tools to form the desired shape. These blocks are commonly attached together with clamps or glue to form a grid-like system. Rebar is then run through the grid, which is then filled with concrete. Polystyrene concrete was invented in 1960. BASF, a German chemical conglomerate, originally created this product, but found no successful applications.\nQuestion: when did they start using rebar in concrete\nYour answer: ",

S. Bhatavdekar, showing a wrestling match at the Hanging Gardens in Bombay, was the first film to be shot by an Indian and the first Indian documentary film.

The song \"\"Will You Go Lassie, Go\"\" (also known as \"\"Wild Mountain Thyme\"\") is sometimes mistakenly credited as a traditional song, but was in fact written by William McPeake, and first recorded by Francis McPeake (and is credited on the album to \"\"F. McPeak\"\").\n[2] Title: \"Wild Mountain Thyme\" Text:  Wild Mountain Thyme \"\"Wild Mountain Thyme\"\" (also known as \"\"Purple Heather\"\" and \"\"Will Ye Go, Lassie, Go?\"\") is an Irish/Scottish folk song. The lyrics and melody are a variant of the song \"\"The Braes of Balquhither\"\" by Scottish poet Robert Tannahill (1774\u20131810) and Scottish composer Robert Archibald Smith (1780\u20131829), but were adapted by Belfast musician Francis McPeake into \"\"Wild Mountain Thyme\"\" and first recorded by his family in the 1950s.\n[3] Title: \"Wild Mountain Thyme\" Text:  The original version of the song, published in 1957, closely paraphrases the Tannahill version, which was published posthumously in 1822. Tannahill's original lyrics include a number of phrases that McPeake carried over into his song, including the lines \"\"Let us go, lassie, go\"\" and \"\"And the wild mountain thyme\"\" as he rewrote the song. The following is a chronological list of recordings of the song. Wild Mountain Thyme \"\"Wild Mountain Thyme\"\" (also known as \"\"Purple Heather\"\" and \"\"Will Ye Go, Lassie, Go?\"\")\n[4] Title: \"Robert Tannahill\" Text:  In addition, there was a large selection in Motherwell's \"\"Harp of Renfrewshire\"\", dating from 1819 and several times reprinted. Later collections of Tannahill's work, augmented by copies of poems preserved by his friends and associates, followed soon after. As well as R.A.Smith's settings, other songs were set by John Ross, the Aberdeen organist. More had been written by Tannahill to accompany traditional Scottish airs, and some from Ireland too. Several have now entered the oral tradition. Perhaps the most enduring is \"\"The Braes of Balquhidder\"\" \u2013 the basis for the ballad \"\"Wild Mountain Thyme,\"\" which has the chorus \"\"Will Ye Go Lassie, Go?\"\"\n[5] Title: \"Culture of the United Kingdom\" Text:  The bagpipes have long been a national symbol of Scotland, and the Great Highland Bagpipe is widely recognised.

A. Milne Estate in the 1960s, the Milne story lines were used by Disney in its cartoon featurette \"\"Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\"\". The \"\"look\"\" of Pooh was adapted by Disney from Stephen Slesinger's distinctive American Pooh with his famous red shirt that had been created and used in commerce by Slesinger since the 1930s.\n[3] Title: \"Winnie the Pooh (Disney character)\" Text:  \"\"Christopher Robin\"\" was released on August 3, 2018 by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures in the United States. During his lifetime, Milne was liberal with his grant of rights. At times he licensed the same exclusive rights to more than one entity. In the United States, E. P. Dutton and Company acquired exclusive volume publication rights and Stephen Slesinger, Inc., acquired sole and exclusive rights to virtually all uses outside of the Dutton books as well as rights to any sorts of future uses. Beginning in 1930 Stephen Slesinger created all of the distinctive and colorful images of Pooh outside of the books.\n[4] Title: \"Winnie the Pooh (Disney character)\" Text:  Winnie the Pooh (Disney character) Winnie the Pooh is a fictional teddy bear and the title character from the Disney media franchise based on A. A. Milne's \"\"Winnie-the-Pooh\"\" (1926) and \"\"The House at Pooh Corner\"\" (1928). Pooh is one of the most popular Disney characters and was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002 and also has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Truman, who kept a sign with that phrase on his desk in the Oval Office. The phrase refers to the notion that the President has to make the decisions and accept the ultimate responsibility for those decisions. Truman received the sign as a gift from a prison warden who was also an avid poker player. It is also the motto of the U.S. Naval Aircraft Carrier USS \"\"Harry S. Truman\"\" (CVN-75).\n[2] Title: \"Button (poker)\" Text:  \"\"Passing the buck\"\" soon became a metaphor for dodging responsibility. U.S. President Harry S. Truman was noted for a sign in his office reading \"\"The buck stops here.\"\" It was a gift from Fred Canfil, who found a similar sign in the warden's office at the Federal Reformatory at El Reno, Oklahoma. The use of other small disks as such markers led to the alternative term \"\"button\"\". Silver dollars were later used as markers and it has been suggested that this is the origin of \"\"buck\"\" as a slang term for \"\"dollar,\"\" though by no means is there universal agreement on this subject.\n[3] Title: \"Harry S. Truman Little White House\" Text:  A 501(c)(3) organization is attempting to further the restoration and hold education conferences each Spring on Truman's impact upon today's society. In 1991, the house opened as a state historic site & museum. Today regular guided tours take visitors through the site, and one can enter the rooms where the Trumans lived, worked and relaxed. Items such as President Truman's briefcase, books, telephone, and his famous \"\"The Buck Stops Here\"\" sign are still at his desk. (The reverse of the sign says, \"\"I'm From Missouri.\"\")\n[4] Title: \"Buck passing\" Text:  President Jimmy Carter arranged to borrow the sign from the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum. Footage from Carter's \"\"Address to the Nation on Energy\"\" shows the sign on the desk during his administration. The reverse of the sign reads, \"\"I'm from Missouri.\"\" This is a reference to Truman's home state, as well as Willard Duncan Vandiver's statement, \"\"I'm from Missouri. You've got to show me\"\".

His poll ratings were sky high when he took office in April 1945 after Roosevelt's sudden death, then plunged to low levels for most of his eight years in office.

It was released on August 6, 1990 as the lead single from his album \"\"No Fences\"\". The song spent four weeks at number one on the Hot Country Songs, and won both the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association awards for 1990 Single of the Year. \"\"Friends in Low Places\"\" was written in 1989 by songwriters Earl Bud Lee and Dewayne Blackwell.\n[2] Title: \"Friends in Low Places\" Text:  The two songwriters had given the song to Brooks to record as a demo soon before the release of his self-titled first album, when he was a relatively unknown singer. Enamored with the song, Brooks recorded the official version the next year. According to Earl Bud Lee, one of the song's co-writers, the idea of the song was born when he and some songwriting friends gathered for lunch one day at Tavern on the Row, a popular Nashville eatery. When the check came, Lee realized he had forgotten his money.\n[3] Title: \"Friends in Low Places\" Text:  He was asked how he was going to pay for the meal, and he replied, \"\"Don't worry. I have friends in low places. I know the cook.\"\" Lee and his songwriting partner, Dewayne Blackwell, immediately recognized that the line \"\"friends in low places\"\" had potential, but they didn't act upon it immediately. Some months later, Lee and Blackwell were at a party, celebrating a recent No. 1 hit by another songwriter. They began to talk about the dormant \"\"friends in low places\"\" idea, and \"\"at that very moment, it all started to come together in a song,\"\" Lee said.\n[4] Title: \"Friends in Low Places\" Text:  Because nothing else was available, they wrote the song on paper napkins. When the songwriters polished \"\"Friends in Low Places\"\", they contacted Garth Brooks to see if he would record a demo for them. Guitarist James Garver would add the name of the bar in the song, \"\"The Oasis\"\", after an establishment in his hometown of Concordia, Kansas. \"\"Friends in Low Places\"\" is in a moderate tempo and the key of A major. The song begins with arpeggios on the chords A, B7, B7, and E9, a pattern which is repeated throughout the verses.\n[5] Title: \"Friends in Low Places\" Text:  The intro was not originally part of the song, but was improvised by session guitarist Mark Casstevens. The author of the intro has been debated since the arpeggio pattern is seen in many of Blackwell's other songs. The chorus uses A-B-E twice before ending on an A chord. An electric guitar solo with pedal steel guitar flourishes is played between the first chorus and second verse. \"\"Friends in Low Places\"\" requires an unusually wide vocal range spanning over two octaves to be sung properly. The song spans from a low note of E to a high of F.

The two rivers meet just north of the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. The northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Sudanese desert to Egypt, then ends in a large delta and flows into the Mediterranean Sea. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of Aswan, and nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt are found along riverbanks.\n[4] Title: Nile Text:  In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan. The river Nile has two major tributaries, the White Nile and Blue Nile. The White Nile is considered to be the headwaters and primary stream of the Nile itself. The Blue Nile, however, is the source of most of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region of central Africa, with the most distant source still undetermined but located in either Rwanda or Burundi. It flows north through Tanzania, Lake Victoria, Uganda and South Sudan.\n[5] Title: Nile Text:  At Khartoum the river is joined by the Blue Nile. The White Nile starts in equatorial East Africa, and the Blue Nile begins in Ethiopia. Both branches are on the western flanks of the East African Rift. The source of the Nile is sometimes considered to be Lake Victoria, but the lake has feeder rivers of considerable size. The Kagera River, which flows into Lake Victoria near the Tanzanian town of Bukoba, is the longest feeder, although sources do not agree on which is the longest tributary of the Kagera and hence the most distant source of the Nile itself.\nQuestion: where is the nile river located in the world\nYour answer: ",

Vehicles in Australia are right-hand drive, and vehicles travel on the left side of the road. The laws for all levels of government, have been mostly harmonised so that drivers do not need to learn different rules as they cross state borders. The usual speed limits are 100 km/h outside of urban areas (110 km/h on some roads where signposted).\n[2] Title: \"Road transport in Australia\" Text:  Heavy transport operators must record their driving time in a log book and take regular rest periods and are limited in how long they can drive without longer sleeping time. If two roads with two lanes each way meet at a roundabout, the roundabout is marked with two lanes as well. Traffic turning left must use the left lane, and traffic turning right must approach in and use the right lane, travelling clockwise around the island in the centre. Traffic going straight through may generally use either lane. Vehicles must indicate their intended direction when approaching the roundabout, and indicate left when passing the exit before the one they intend to leave on.\n[3] Title: Drive-through Text:  Most drive-through lanes are designed so the service windows and speaker are on the driver's side of the car, for example, in left-hand traffic (right-hand drive) countries such as the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, the windows will be on the right side of the drive-through lane, and vice versa in right-hand traffic (left-hand drive) countries such as North America and mainland Europe. There are a few drive-through lanes designed with the service windows on the passenger side, but these lanes are disfavored as they cannot be used easily by cars with only a driver.\n[4] Title: \"Shoulder (road)\" Text:  Shoulder (road) A shoulder, or hard shoulder is an emergency stopping lane by the verge of a road or motorway, on the right in countries which drive on the right, or on the left side in India, Japan, the UK, Australia, and other left-side driving countries. Many wider US and Swedish freeways have shoulders on both sides of each directional carriageway, in the median as well as at the outer edges of the road, for additional safety. Shoulders are not intended for use by through traffic, although there are exceptions (see below).\n[5] Title: \"Shoulder (road)\" Text:  In a similar manner to Canada, Italy and the United States, as described above, the shoulders located on the side of Australia's highways are normally used as an emergency lane in the case of a breakdown or by emergency vehicles in the case of road congestion. However, no mandatory regulations exist to wear a high visibility jacket when dismounting from the vehicle stopped in an emergency lane. A recent study conducted by the National Coroners Information System (NCIS) in Australia has revealed 29 closed case fatalities (and at least a dozen case fatalities still under coronial investigation) that had been reported to Australian coroners where a person was \"\"struck in an emergency lane after their vehicle had stopped\"\" between July 2000 and November 2010.\nQuestion: what side of the road to they drive on in australia\nYour answer: ",

According to historian David Simonelli, such was the Beatles' international influence, it was the song that formally announced the arrival of flower power ideology as a mainstream concept. The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 11 September 1967.\n[3] Title: \"All You Need Is Love\" Text:  \"\"All You Need Is Love\"\" was selected for \"\"Our World\"\" for its contemporary social significance over the Paul McCartney-written \"\"Your Mother Should Know\"\". In a statement to \"\"Melody Maker\"\" magazine, Brian Epstein, the band's manager, said of \"\"All You Need Is Love\"\": \"\"It was an inspired song and they really wanted to give the world a message.

It is a clear message saying that love is everything.\"\"\n[4] Title: \"All You Need Is Love\" Text:  With an orchestral arrangement by George Martin, the song opens with a portion of the French national anthem and ends with musical quotations from works such as Glenn Miller's \"\"In the Mood\"\", \"\"Greensleaves\"\", and Bach's Invention No. 8 in F major, as well as the chorus of the Beatles' 1963 hit \"\"She Loves You\"\".

Laing wrote about the song's contemporary appeal: The times fitted [the Beatles] like a glove. Everyone was getting the feel of the world as a global village \u2013 as us, one species. The whole human race was becoming unified under the shadow of death ... One of the most heartening things about the Beatles was that they gave expression to a shared sense of celebration around the world, a sense of the same sensibility.

Montgomery as the Tin Woodman (who is called Niccolo Chopper in the musical; he had no name in the original book, but would be called Nick Chopper in the sequels). Arthur Hill played the Cowardly Lion, but in this version his role was reduced to a bit part. The Wicked Witch of the West is mentioned but does not appear in this version, and Toto is replaced by a cow named Imogene. An element from the show \u2013 the snowfall caused by the Good Witch of the North, which defeats the spell of the poppies that had put Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion to sleep \u2013 was later used in the classic 1939 movie.\n[2] Title: \"Bert Lahr\" Text:  Bert Lahr Irving Lahrheim (August 13, 1895 \u2013 December 4, 1967) stage name Bert Lahr, was an American actor of stage and screen, vaudevillian and comedian. Lahr is best known for his role as the Cowardly Lion, as well as his counterpart Kansas farmworker \"\"Zeke\"\", in the MGM adaptation of \"\"The Wizard of Oz\"\" (1939). He was well known for his explosive humor, but also adapted well to dramatic roles and his work in burlesque, vaudeville, and on Broadway.\n[3] Title: \"Bert Lahr\" Text:  Lahr was signed to play the role on July 25, Lahr's lion costume was composed of lion fur and, under the high-intensity lighting required for Oz's Technicolor scenes, the costume was unbearably hot. Lahr contributed ad-lib comedic lines for his character. Many of Lahr's scenes took several takes because other cast members, especially Garland, couldn't complete the scenes without laughing. The Cowardly Lion is the only character who sings two solo song numbers-\"\"If I Only Had the Nerve\"\", performed after the initial meeting with Dorothy, The Scarecrow, and The Tin Man in the forest, and \"\"If I Were King of the Forest\"\", performed while he and the others are awaiting their audience with the Wizard.\n[4] Title: \"If I Were King of the Forest\" Text:  If I Were King of the Forest \"\"If I Were King of the Forest\"\" is a song from the 1939 film \"\"The Wizard of Oz\"\", with music by Harold Arlen and lyrics by E.Y. Harburg. The comic number is sung by the Cowardly Lion played by Bert Lahr during the scene at the Emerald City, when the Lion, Dorothy (with Toto), Tin Woodsman and Scarecrow are waiting to learn whether the Wizard will grant them an audience. Lahr employs a spoken interlude during the number, in which the rest of the group ask him how he would deal with other powerful animals if he were king, for example: The song contains the line \"\"What makes the Hottentot so Hot?\"\"\n[5] Title: \"Nathan Lane\" Text:  It was also the feature film debut of Gore Verbinski, who later went on to direct \"\"Pirates of the Caribbean\"\".

Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra performed the song with vocals by Bob Lawrence.\n[3] Title: \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" Text:  This version of the song topped music charts in 1934. The Tommy Dorsey orchestra released their version in 1938. The B-side to Dorsey's single was \"\"Night and Day\"\". During the mid-to-late 1930s Larry Adler and Henry Hall recorded live radio performances of the song on BBC Radio. Adler's rendition was a syncopated, harmonic arrangement.

On 11 August 2017, Morocco officially announced a bid to host. Therefore, the official 2026 FIFA World Cup bids were from two football confederations. The first one was from CONCACAF, which was triple bid by Canada, United States and Mexico, and the second one was from CAF with a bid by Morocco.\n[2] Title: \"FIFA World Cup\" Text:  However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018. This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder. The 2026 FIFA World Cup was chosen to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico, marking the first time a World Cup has been shared by three host nations. The 2026 tournament will be the biggest World Cup ever held, with 48 teams playing 80 matches.\n[3] Title: \"FIFA World Cup hosts\" Text:  Only the 2002 FIFA World Cup had more than one host, being split between Japan and South Korea. Upon the selection of Canada\u2013Mexico\u2013United States bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the tournament will be the first to be hosted by more than two countries. Mexico becomes the first country to host three men's World Cups and its Estadio Azteca, should it be selected, will become the first stadium to stage three World Cup tournaments. Except 1934, host nations are granted an automatic spot in the World Cup group stages.\n[4] Title: \"FIFA World Cup hosts\" Text:  The bidding process was originally scheduled to start in 2015, with the appointment of hosts scheduled for the FIFA Congress on 10 May 2017 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. On 10 June 2015, FIFA announced that the bid process for the 2026 FIFA World Cup was postponed. However, following the FIFA Council meeting on 10 May 2016, a new bid schedule was announced for May 2020 as the last in a four-phase process. On 14 October 2016, FIFA said it would accept a tournament-sharing bid by CONCACAF members Canada, Mexico and the United States.\n[5] Title: \"FIFA World Cup\" Text:  Qatar are planned as hosts of the 2022 finals, and 2026 will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States and Mexico, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to have hosted games in three finals. The world's first international football match was a challenge match played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England, which ended in a 0\u20130 draw. The first international tournament, the inaugural British Home Championship, took place in 1884. As football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the start of the 20th century, it was held as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics (however, the IOC has retroactively upgraded their status to official events), and at the 1906 Intercalated Games.\nQuestion: where 's the next world cup going to be 2026\nYour answer: ",

After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Dreyer and Edy gave the flavor its current name \"\"to give folks something to smile about in the midst of the Great Depression.\"\" Alternatively, Fentons Creamery in Oakland claims that William Dreyer based his recipe on a Rocky Road-style ice cream flavor invented by his friend, Fentons' George Farren, who blended his own Rocky Road-style candy bar into ice cream; however, Dreyer substituted almonds for walnuts. The original Rocky Road ice cream used chocolate ice cream with no chocolate chip pieces.\n[2] Title: \"Rocky road (ice cream)\" Text:  Rocky road (ice cream) Rocky road ice cream is a chocolate flavored ice cream. Though there are variations from the original flavor, it is traditionally composed of chocolate ice cream, nuts, and whole or diced marshmallows. According to one source, the flavor was created in March 1929 by William Dreyer in Oakland, California when he cut up walnuts and marshmallows with his wife's sewing scissors and added them to his chocolate ice cream in a manner that reflected how his partner Joseph Edy's chocolate candy creation incorporated walnuts and marshmallow pieces.\n[3] Title: \"Dreyer's\" Text:  In 1928 Edy and Dreyer decided to join forces to manufacture ice cream. They secured a small factory and launched Edy's Grand Ice Cream (the \"\"Grand\"\" reflected their street address on Grand Avenue in Oakland). They focused on creative innovations to fuel their small venture. For example, the two men used Joseph Edy\u2019s knowledge and expertise in candy-making to create the original Rocky Road ice cream, from a combination of flavors which Edy had previously invented. The chocolate, marshmallow, and nut flavor was named Rocky Road as a means of describing the ice cream\u2019s texture as well as the troubled economic times of the Great Depression.\n[4] Title: \"Dreyer's\" Text:  Edy and Dreyer are also credited with originating the Toasted Almond and Candy Mint flavors. At the time ice cream had limited flavors such as vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry, but Rocky Road, introduced in 1929, was one of the first combination of flavors. Because only large marshmallows were manufactured at the time, he used his wife\u2019s sewing scissors to cut marshmallows into bite-sized pieces to make the first batch of Rocky Road. In 2002, Nestl\u00e9 insisted on a smaller container to increase profits and so the standard US half gallon (2 quarts) container (1.89 L) was downsized to 1.75 quarts (1.65 L) container.\n[5] Title: \"Rocky road (dessert)\" Text:  According to this origin story, the name comes from the rocky road that travelers had to take to reach the gold fields.

The French lyrics remain unaltered. \"\"O Canada\"\" had served as a \"\"de facto\"\" national anthem since 1939, officially becoming the country's national anthem in 1980 when Canada's National Anthem Act received royal assent and became effective on July 1 as part of that year's Dominion Day (now known as Canada Day) celebrations.\n[2] Title: \"O Canada\" Text:  For \"\"O Canada\"\", the Robert Stanley Weir version of 1908 was recommended for the English words, with a few minor changes: two of the \"\"stand on guard\"\" phrases were replaced with \"\"from far and wide\"\" and \"\"God keep our land\"\". In 1970 the Queen in Right of Canada purchased the right to the lyrics and music of \"\"O Canada\"\" from Gordon V. Thompson Music for $1. The song finally became the official national anthem in 1980 with the passage of the National Anthem Act.\n[3] Title: \"O Canada\" Text:  In 1967, the Prime Minister advised Governor General Georges Vanier to appoint the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on the National and Royal Anthems; the group first met in February and, within two months, on April 12, 1967, presented its conclusion that \"\"O Canada\"\" should be designated as the national anthem and \"\"God Save the Queen\"\" as the royal anthem of Canada, one verse from each, in both official languages, to be adopted by parliament. The group was then charged with establishing official lyrics for each song.\n[4] Title: \"God Save the Queen\" Text:  By-laws and practices governing the use of either song during public events in municipalities varied; in Toronto, \"\"God Save the Queen\"\" was employed, while in Montreal it was \"\"O Canada\"\". Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1964 said one song would have to be chosen as the country's national anthem and, three years later, he advised Governor General Georges Vanier to appoint the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on the National and Royal Anthems. Within two months, on 12 April 1967, the committee presented its conclusion that \"\"God Save the Queen\"\", whose music and lyrics were found to be in the public domain, should be designated as the Royal Anthem of Canada and \"\"O Canada\"\" as the national anthem, one verse from each, in both official languages, to be adopted by parliament.\n[5] Title: \"O Canada\" Text:  By-laws and practices governing the use of song during public events in municipalities varied; in Toronto, \"\"God Save the Queen\"\" was employed, while in Montreal it was \"\"O Canada\"\".

Likewise, were a president-elect to die during the transition period, or decline to serve, the vice president-elect would become president on Inauguration Day. A vice president can also become the acting president if the president becomes incapacitated. If the presidency and vice presidency both become vacant however, the statutory successor called upon would not become president, but would only be acting as president. To date, two vice presidents\u2014George H. W. Bush (once) and Dick Cheney (twice)\u2014have been acting president.\n[2] Title: \"Article Two of the United States Constitution\" Text:  The 25th Amendment explicitly states that if the President dies, resigns or is removed from office, the Vice President becomes President, and also establishes a procedure for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President. The Amendment further provides that the President, or the Vice President and Cabinet, can declare the President unable to discharge his duties, in which case the Vice President becomes Acting President.

The core of the Japanese forces were the samurai, the military caste of Japan who dominated Japanese society. Japanese society was divided into four castes: samurai, peasants, artisans, and merchants, in that order. The samurai caste owned most of the land in Japan, had the sole right to carry swords and to execute on the spot any commoner who was insufficiently deferential, and were ones allowed to own horses and ride into battle.\n[2] Title: Samurai Text:  Thus, the samurai-class appeared as the political ruling power in Japan. Various samurai clans struggled for power during the Kamakura and Ashikaga shogunates. Zen Buddhism spread among the samurai in the 13th century and helped to shape their standards of conduct, particularly overcoming the fear of death and killing, but among the general populace Pure Land Buddhism was favored. In 1274, the Mongol-founded Yuan dynasty in China sent a force of some 40,000 men and 900 ships to invade Japan in northern Ky\u016bsh\u016b. Japan mustered a mere 10,000 samurai to meet this threat.\n[3] Title: Militarism Text:  This was evident in 15th-century Japan's \"\"Sengoku\"\" period or \"\"Age of Warring States\"\", where powerful samurai warlords (\"\"daimy\u014ds\"\") played a significant role in Japanese politics. Japan's militarism is deeply rooted in the ancient samurai tradition, centuries before Japan's modernization. Even though a militarist philosophy was intrinsic to the shogunates, a nationalist style of militarism developed after the Meiji Restoration, which restored the Emperor to power and began the Empire of Japan. It is exemplified by the 1882 Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors, which called for all members of the armed forces to have an absolute personal loyalty to the Emperor.\n[4] Title: Samurai Text:  Groups of mercenaries with mass-produced arquebuses began playing a critical role. By the end of the Sengoku period, several hundred thousand firearms existed in Japan and massive armies numbering over 100,000 clashed in battles. Oda Nobunaga was the well-known lord of the Nagoya area (once called Owari Province) and an exceptional example of a samurai of the Sengoku period. He came within a few years of, and laid down the path for his successors to follow, the reunification of Japan under a new \"\"bakufu\"\" (shogunate).\n[5] Title: \"History of Shinto\u0304 Muso\u0304-ryu\u0304\" Text:  The relatively peaceful Edo period took away the means of the samurai to fully develop and test their skills in actual battlefield combat. The role of the samurai would eventually change from being warriors, constantly fighting battles for their liege lord (\"\"daimy\u014d\"\"), into the role of providing internal security with increasingly more bureaucratic duties. Instead of fighting the frequent wars and battles of the old days, with the exception of the siege of Osaka in 1615 and the Shimabara Rebellion in 1637, many samurai resorted to duelling other samurai with others going on the road as a wandering swordsman to test their skills against other swordsmen such as bandits and \"\"r\u014dnin\"\", and some would train in far away schools (\"\"ry\u016b\"\") to hone their skill.\nQuestion: what role did samurai play in japanese society\nYour answer: ",

To his surprise and chagrin, Caesar had named his grandnephew Gaius Octavius his sole heir (hence the name Octavian), bequeathing him the immensely potent Caesar name and making him one of the wealthiest citizens in the Republic. The crowd at the funeral boiled over, throwing dry branches, furniture, and even clothing on to Caesar's funeral pyre, causing the flames to spin out of control, seriously damaging the Forum.\n[2] Title: \"Gaius Julius Caesar\" Text:  Named dictator in perpetuity, Caesar was assassinated by a group of senators on the Ides of March, 44 BC. The years after his death saw the demise of the Roman Republic, and the establishment of the Roman emperors. Born \"\"Gaius Octavius\"\", the grandnephew of the dictator was adopted by will as his son and heir, becoming Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus. After avenging himself on his uncle's murderers and political opponents, Octavian and his allies formed the Second triumvirate. After defeating his former friend, Marcus Antonius, at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, Octavian became the sole master of the Roman world.\n[3] Title: \"Julius Caesar\" Text:  On Caesar's return to Italy in September 45 BC, he filed his will, naming his grandnephew Gaius Octavius (Octavian, later known as Augustus Caesar) as his principal heir, leaving his vast estate and property including his name. Caesar also wrote that if Octavian died before Caesar did, Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus would be the next heir in succession. In his will, he also left a substantial gift to the citizens of Rome. During his early career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and dysfunctional the Roman Republic had become.\n[4] Title: \"Julius Caesar\" Text:  On the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC Caesar was assassinated by a group of rebellious senators led by Gaius Cassius Longinus, Marcus Junius Brutus and Decimus Junius Brutus, who stabbed him to death. A new series of civil wars broke out and the constitutional government of the Republic was never fully restored. Caesar's adopted heir Octavian, later known as Augustus, rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the civil war. Octavian set about solidifying his power and the era of the Roman Empire began. Much of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust.\n[5] Title: \"Roman emperor\" Text:  He gained these positions by senatorial consent. By the time of his assassination, he was the most powerful man in the Roman world. In his will, Caesar appointed his adopted son Octavian as his heir. On Caesar's death, Octavian inherited his adoptive father's property and lineage, the loyalty of most of his allies and \u2013 again through a formal process of senatorial consent \u2013 an increasing number of the titles and offices that had accrued to Caesar.

Emmeline Pankhurst, along with two of her daughters, Christabel and Sylvia, and her husband, Richard, before his death in 1898, had been active in the Independent Labour Party (ILP), founded in 1893 by Keir Hardie, a family friend. (Hardie later founded the Labour Party.) Emmeline Pankhurst had increasingly felt that the ILP was not there for women.\n[2] Title: \"Emmeline Pankhurst\" Text:  Thus on 10 October 1903 Pankhurst and several colleagues founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), an organisation open only to women and focused on direct action to win the vote. \"\"Deeds,\"\" she wrote later, \"\"not words, was to be our permanent motto.\"\" The group's early militancy took non-violent forms. In addition to making speeches and gathering petition signatures, the WSPU organised rallies and published a newsletter called \"\"Votes for Women.\"\" The group also convened a series of \"\"Women's Parliaments\"\" to coincide with official government sessions.\n[3] Title: \"Emmeline Pankhurst\" Text:  In 1903, Pankhurst founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), an all-women suffrage advocacy organisation dedicated to \"\"deeds, not words\"\". The group identified as independent from \u2013 and often in opposition to \u2013 political parties. It became known for physical confrontations: its members smashed windows and assaulted police officers. Pankhurst, her daughters, and other WSPU activists received repeated prison sentences, where they staged hunger strikes to secure better conditions, and were often force fed. As Pankhurst's eldest daughter Christabel took leadership of the WSPU, antagonism between the group and the government grew.\n[4] Title: \"Women's Social and Political Union\" Text:  Women's Social and Political Union The Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) was a women-only political movement and leading militant organisation campaigning for women's suffrage in the United Kingdom from 1903 to 1917.

Typically the developer will transfer ownership of the association to the homeowners after selling a predetermined number of lots. Generally any person who wants to buy a residence within the area of a homeowners association must become a member, and therefore must obey the governing documents including Articles of Incorporation, CC&Rs (Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions) and By-Laws, which may limit the owner's choices.\n[2] Title: \"Homeowner association\" Text:  The HOA will be governed by a board of directors. Initially the board is composed of developer-appointed members, in order to maintain the character of the community that the developer has for it. As the percentage of ownership shifts from the developer toward owners, the corresponding percentage changes from developer-appointed members to homeowners elected at an annual meeting, and ultimately the board will consist solely of homeowner-elected members. Usually the board (or parts of it) will be elected at an annual meeting of the homeowners, as specified in the Bylaws.\n[3] Title: Condominium Text:  These structures are preferred by some planned neighborhoods and gated communities. A homeowners association (HOA), whose members are the unit owners, manages the condominium through a board of directors elected by the membership. This exists under various names depending on the jurisdiction, such as \"\"unit title\"\", \"\"sectional title\"\", \"\"commonhold\"\", \"\"strata council\"\", or \"\"tenant-owner's association\"\", \"\"body corporate\"\", \"\"Owners Corporation\"\", \"\"condominium corporation\"\" or \"\"condominium association\"\".\n[4] Title: Condominium Text:  Condominium bylaws usually establish the responsibilities of the owners' association; the voting procedures to be used at association meetings; the qualifications, powers, and duties of the board of directors; the powers and duties of the officers; and the obligations of the owners with regard to assessments, maintenance, and use of the units and common areas. Finally, a set of rules and regulations providing specific details of restrictions on conduct of unit owners and residents are established by the HOA. These are more readily amendable than the declaration or association bylaws, typically requiring only a vote of the HOA board.\n[5] Title: Condominium Text:  The description of the condominium units and the common areas and any restrictions on their use is established in a document commonly called a \"\"Master Deed\"\" (also known as the \"\"Enabling Declaration\"\", the \"\"Declaration of Conditions\"\", or the \"\"Condominium Document\"\"). Among other things, this document provides for the creation of the HOA.

The notion of a heliocentric Solar System, with the Sun at the center, is possibly first suggested in the Vedic literature of ancient India, which often refer to the Sun as the \"\"centre of spheres\"\". Some interpret Aryabhatta's writings in \u0100ryabha\u1e6d\u012bya as implicitly heliocentric. The idea was first proposed in Western philosophy and Greek astronomy as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos, but received no support from most other ancient astronomers.\n[2] Title: Sun Text:  The theory that the Sun is the center around which the planets orbit was first proposed by the ancient Greek Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BC, and later adopted by Seleucus of Seleucia (see Heliocentrism). This view was developed in a more detailed mathematical model of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by Nicolaus Copernicus. Observations of sunspots were recorded during the Han Dynasty (206 BC\u2013AD 220) by Chinese astronomers, who maintained records of these observations for centuries. Averroes also provided a description of sunspots in the 12th century.\n[3] Title: Heliocentrism Text:  Heliocentrism Heliocentrism is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Solar System. Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos, but at least in the medieval world, Aristarchus's heliocentrism attracted little attention\u2014possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era. It was not until the 16th century that a mathematical model of a heliocentric system was presented, by the Renaissance mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic cleric Nicolaus Copernicus, leading to the Copernican Revolution.\n[4] Title: \"Formation and evolution of the Solar System\" Text:  The first step toward a theory of Solar System formation and evolution was the general acceptance of heliocentrism, which placed the Sun at the centre of the system and the Earth in orbit around it. This concept had developed for millennia (Aristarchus of Samos had suggested it as early as 250 BC), but was not widely accepted until the end of the 17th century. The first recorded use of the term \"\"Solar System\"\" dates from 1704. The current standard theory for Solar System formation, the nebular hypothesis, has fallen into and out of favour since its formulation by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century.\n[5] Title: \"Solar System\" Text:  For most of history, humanity did not recognize or understand the concept of the Solar System. Most people up to the Late Middle Ages\u2013Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky. Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically predictive heliocentric system. In the 17th century, Galileo discovered that the Sun was marked with sunspots, and that Jupiter had four satellites in orbit around it.\nQuestion: who said sun is the center of the solar system\nYour answer: ",

Long after the city grew to the seven hills the Palatine remained a desirable residential area. Emperor Caesar Augustus lived there in a purposely modest house only set apart from his neighbours by the two laurel trees planted to flank the front door as a sign of triumph granted by the Senate. His descendants, especially Nero, with his \"\"Golden House\"\", enlarged the house and grounds over and over until it took up the hill top.\n[2] Title: Rome Text:  He was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death in 395 his sons, Arcadius and Honorius divided the empire into a western and an eastern part. The seat of government in the Western Roman Empire was transferred to Ravenna after the siege of Milan in 402. During the 5th century, the emperors from the 430s mostly resided in the capital, Rome. Rome, which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire, was sacked in 410 by the Visigoths led by Alaric I, but very little physical damage was done, most of which was repaired.\n[3] Title: \"Probus (emperor)\" Text:  In 281, the emperor was in Rome, where he celebrated his well-deserved triumph. Probus was eager to start his eastern campaign, delayed by the revolts in the west. He left Rome in 282, travelling first towards Sirmium, his birth city. Different accounts of Probus's death exist. According to Joannes Zonaras, the commander of the Praetorian Guard Marcus Aurelius Carus had been proclaimed, more or less unwillingly, emperor by his troops. Probus sent some troops against the new usurper, but when those troops changed sides and supported Carus, Probus' remaining soldiers assassinated him at Sirmium (September/October 282).\n[4] Title: Diocletian Text:  Long before Diocletian, Gallienus (r. 253\u201368) had chosen Milan as the seat of his headquarters. If the panegyric detailing the ceremony implied that the true center of the empire was not Rome, but where the emperor sat (\"\"...the capital of the empire appeared to be there, where the two emperors met\"\"), it simply echoed what had already been stated by the historian Herodian in the early third century: \"\"Rome is where the emperor is\"\". During the meeting, decisions on matters of politics and war were probably made in secret.\n[5] Title: Emperor Text:  Historians generally refer to the continuing Roman Empire in the east as the Byzantine Empire after Byzantium, the original name of the town that Constantine I would elevate to the Imperial capital as New Rome in AD 330. (The city is more commonly called Constantinople and is today named Istanbul). Although the empire was again subdivided and a co-emperor sent to Italy at the end of the fourth century, the office became unitary again only 95 years later at the request of the Roman Senate and following the death of Julius Nepos, last Western Emperor.\nQuestion: where did the emperor live in ancient rome\nYour answer: ",

The campaign consisted of a series of battles fought between July and November 1942 in what was then the Australian Territory of Papua. It was primarily a land battle, between the Japanese South Seas Detachment under Major General Tomitar\u014d Horii and Australian and Papuan land forces under command of New Guinea Force. The Japanese objective was to seize Port Moresby by an overland advance from the north coast, following the Kokoda Track over the mountains of the Owen Stanley Range, as part of a strategy to isolate Australia from the United States.\n[2] Title: \"Kokoda Track campaign\" Text:  Adrian Threlfall, in his thesis and subsequent book explores the challenges faced and how these shaped the Australian Army as a jungle warfare force. Kokoda Track campaign The Kokoda Track campaign or Kokoda Trail campaign was part of the Pacific War of World War II. The campaign consisted of a series of battles fought between July and November 1942 in what was then the Australian Territory of Papua. It was primarily a land battle, between the Japanese South Seas Detachment under Major General Tomitar\u014d Horii and Australian and Papuan land forces under command of New Guinea Force.\n[3] Title: \"Kokoda Track campaign\" Text:  Australian forces were unprepared to conduct a campaign in the jungle environment of New Guinea. The lessons learned during the course of this campaign and the subsequent battle of Buna\u2013Gona led to widespread changes in doctrine, training, equipment and structure, with a legacy that remains until the present day. In consequence of the rapid Japanese advance and the perceived failure to quickly counterattack, a \"\"crisis of command\"\" resulted, in which manoeuvring by General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the South West Pacific Area, and General Sir Thomas Blamey, commander of Allied Land Forces, resulted in the sackings of three high-ranking Australian officers.\n[4] Title: \"Kokoda Track campaign\" Text:  Papua and New Guinea had been the Australian 8th Military District under command of Morris. On 9 April 1942, it was formed into New Guinea Force, with Morris promoted major general. As events escalated and the forces involved increased, Rowell arrived from Australia with HQ I Corps, taking command of the force on 12 August 1942. Morris was moved to command the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU). At about this time, 7th Division was deploying to New Guinea and responsibility for the immediate defence of Port Moresby, including Maroubra Force and the Kokoda Track operation was devolved to divisional headquarters under Allan.\n[5] Title: \"Kokoda Track campaign\" Text:  Nonetheless, MacArthur persuaded the Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, to send Blamey to New Guinea to take command there and \"\"energise the situation\"\". By this manoeuvre, MacArthur ensured that Blamey would be the scapegoat if Port Moresby fell. MacArthur visited Port Moresby briefly from 2 October. On 3 October, he went as far forward as Owers' Corner, where he spent about an hour. He was present as the 16th Brigade, under Brigadier John Lloyd, was commencing its advance along the track. He subsequently established his advance headquarters in Port Moresby on 6 November 1942 (just after Kokoda was reoccupied) until January 1943.\nQuestion: who was involved in the kokoda trail campaign\nYour answer: ",

Perseus, wearing the helmet, captures Pegasus and follows Calibos' giant vulture carrying off Andromeda's spirit during her sleep to learn the next riddle. Perseus is discovered and nearly killed by Calibos, but manages to sever one of Calibos' hands, losing his helmet in the process. The next morning, Perseus presents himself as suitor and correctly answers the riddle, winning Andromeda's hand in marriage.\n[2] Title: \"Cap of invisibility\" Text:  The messenger god Hermes wore the Cap during his battle with Hippolytus, the giant. In some stories, Perseus received the Cap of Invisibility (along with the Winged Sandals) from Athena when he went to slay the Gorgon Medusa, which helped him escape her sisters. In other myths, however, Perseus obtained these items from the Stygian nymphs. The Cap of Invisibility was not used to avoid the Gorgons' petrifying gazes, but rather to escape from the immortal Sthenno and Euryale later on after he had decapitated Medusa. In the \"\"Dragon Quest\"\" role-playing video game series, there is a piece of equipment named \"\"Hades' helm.\"\"\n[3] Title: \"Cap of invisibility\" Text:  Cap of invisibility In classical mythology, the Cap of Invisibility (\u1f0d\u03ca\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03b7\u03bd \"\"(H)a\u00efdos kune\u0113n\"\" in Greek, lit. dog-skin of Hades) is a helmet or cap that can turn the wearer invisible. It is also known as the Cap of Hades, Helm of Hades, or Helm of Darkness. Wearers of the cap in Greek myths include Athena, the goddess of wisdom, the messenger god Hermes, and the hero Perseus. The Cap of Invisibility enables the user to become invisible to other supernatural entities, functioning much like the cloud of mist that the gods surround themselves in to become undetectable.\n[4] Title: Talaria Text:  Later authors repeat this characteristic, for instance in the Orphic Hymns XXVIII (to Hermes). Perseus wears them to help him slay Medusa. According to Aeschylus, Hermes gives them to him directly. In a better-attested version, Perseus must retrieve them from the Graeae, along with the cap of invisibility and the (sack). However, Perseus sees poorly because Hermes does not have his own sandals, nor Hades his own helmet. In Rick Riordan's fantasy-adventure novel \"\"The Lightning Thief\"\", the Talaria is in the form of sneakers instead of sandals.\n[5] Title: Perseus Text:  When the sisters led him to the Hesperides, he returned what he had taken. From the Hesperides he received a knapsack (\"\"kibisis\"\") to safely contain Medusa's head. Zeus gave him an adamantine sword (a Harpe) and Hades' helm of darkness to hide. Hermes lent Perseus winged sandals to fly, and Athena gave him a polished shield. Perseus then proceeded to the Gorgons' cave. In the cave he came upon the sleeping Medusa. By viewing Medusa's reflection in his polished shield, he safely approached and cut off her head.\nQuestion: what was given to perseus to make him invisible\nYour answer: ",

We Have No Bananas\" Text:  We Have No Bananas Blues\"\", recorded by Billy Jones, Sam Lanin (with vocals by Irving Kaufman and others) in 1923. Frank Silver explained the origin of the song to \"\"Time Magazine\"\": \"\"I am an American, of Jewish ancestry, with a wife and a young son. About a year ago my little orchestra was playing at a Long Island hotel. To and from the hotel I was wont to stop at a fruit stand owned by a Greek, who began every sentence with 'Yess.'\n[4] Title: \"Yes! We Have No Bananas\" Text:  The jingle of his idiom haunted me and my friend Cohn. Finally I wrote this verse and Cohn fitted it with a tune.\"\" Silver may have been influenced by an actual shortage of Gros Michel bananas in the early 20th century, caused by Panama disease. The song was the theme of the outdoor relief protests in Belfast in 1932. These were a unique example of Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland protesting together, and the song was used because it was one of the few non-sectarian songs that both communities knew.\n[5] Title: \"Yes! We Have No Bananas\" Text:  The song lent its title to a book about the depression in Belfast. The term has been resurrected on many occasions, including during rationing in the United Kingdom in World War II, when the British government banned imports of bananas for five years. Shop owners put signs stating \"\"Yes, we have no bananas\"\" in their shop windows in keeping with the war spirit. The song was the subject of a column by Sigmund Spaeth, who suggested that the melody could have been derived from a combination of parts of other songs, including the \"\"Hallelujah Chorus\"\" from \"\"Messiah\"\" by Handel, \"\"My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean\"\", \"\"I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls\"\", \"\"Aunt Dinah's Quilting Party\"\", and Cole Porter's \"\"An Old-Fashioned Garden\"\".\nQuestion: when was yes we have no bananas written\nYour answer: ",

The 1970 film with Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff is the first colour version of the novel, and gained acceptance over the years though it was initially poorly received. The character of Hindley is portrayed much more sympathetically, and his story-arc is altered. It also subtly suggests that Heathcliff may be Cathy's illegitimate half-brother. In 1978 the BBC produced a five-part TV serialisation of the book starring Ken Hutchinson, Kay Adshead and John Duttine with music by Carl Davis; it is considered one of the most faithful adaptations of Emily Bront\u00eb's story.\nQuestion: who played cathy in the bbc mini series of wuthering heights\nYour answer: ",

The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea. By contrast, Hopkinson's flag for the United States had seven white stripes, and six red ones \u2013 in reality, six red stripes laid on a white background. Hopkinson's sketches have not been found, but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty (naval) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time.\n[2] Title: \"Flag of the United States\" Text:  Flag of the United States The flag of the United States of America, often referred to as the American flag, is the national flag of the United States.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"C major\" Text:  C major C major (or the key of C) is a major scale based on C, with the pitches C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. C major is one of the most common key signatures used in western music. Its key signature has no flats and no sharps. Its relative minor is A minor and its parallel minor is C minor. The C major scale is: \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\relative c' { </score> On the piano, the C major scale can be played by playing the white keys starting on C. Twenty of Joseph Haydn's 104 symphonies are in C major, making it his second most-used key, second only to D major.\n[2] Title: \"Key signature\" Text:  Exceptions include: The convention for the notation of key signatures follows the circle of fifths. Starting from C major (or equivalently A minor) which has no sharps or flats, successively raising the key by a fifth adds a sharp, going clockwise round the circle of fifths. The new sharp is placed on the new key's leading note (seventh degree) for major keys or supertonic (second degree) for minor keys. Thus G major (E minor) has one sharp which is on the F; then D major (B minor) has two sharps on F and C and so on.\n[3] Title: \"Relative key\" Text:  Relative keys are closely related keys, the keys between which most modulations occur, in that they differ by no more than one accidental (none in the case of relative keys). The minor key starts three semitones below its relative major; for example, A minor is three semitones below its relative, C major. For example, G major and E minor both have a single sharp in their key signature at F; therefore, E minor is the relative minor of G major, and conversely G major is the relative major of E minor.\n[4] Title: Submediant Text:  In the C major scale (white keys on a piano, starting on C), the submediant is the note A; and the submediant chord is A-minor, consisting of the notes A, C, and E. Therefore, Am is the vi chord in the C major scale. The scales of C major and A (natural) minor have the property of sharing the same notes: they are said to be the relative of each other, and the C major and A minor chords are also said the relative of each other.\n[5] Title: \"In C\" Text:  The original recording of the piece was created by 11 musicians (although, through overdubbing, several dozen instruments were utilized), while a performance in 2006 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall featured 124 musicians. The piece begins on a C major chord (patterns one through seven) with a strong emphasis on the mediant E and the entrance of the note F which begins a series of slow progressions to other chords suggesting a few subtle and ambiguous changes of key, the last pattern being an alteration between B and G. Though the polyphonic interplay of the various patterns against each other and themselves at different rhythmic displacements is of primary interest, the piece may be considered heterophonic.\nQuestion: where does do start in the key of c\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Johannes Gutenberg\" Text:  Johannes Gutenberg Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg (; \u2013 February 3, 1468) was a German blacksmith, goldsmith, inventor, printer, and publisher who introduced printing to Europe with the printing press. His introduction of mechanical movable type printing to Europe started the Printing Revolution and is regarded as a milestone of the second millennium, ushering in the modern period of human history. It played a key role in the development of the Renaissance, Reformation, the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific revolution and laid the material basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to the masses.\n[2] Title: \"Renaissance technology\" Text:  Printing press The invention of the printing press by the German goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg (1398\u20131468) is widely regarded as the single most important event of the second millennium, and is one of the defining moments of the Renaissance. The Printing Revolution which it sparks throughout Europe works as a modern \"\"agent of change\"\" in the transformation of medieval society. The mechanical device consists of a screw press modified for printing purposes which can produce 3,600 pages per workday, allowing the mass production of printed books on a proto-industrial scale.\n[3] Title: \"History of Germany\" Text:  About 100 years later, Walther von der Vogelweide (c. 1170 \u2013 c. 1230) became the most celebrated of the Middle High German lyric poets. Around 1439, Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz, used movable type printing and issued the Gutenberg Bible. He was the global inventor of the printing press, thereby starting the Printing Revolution. Cheap printed books and pamphlets played central roles for the spread of the Reformation and the Scientific Revolution. Around the transition from the 15th to the 16th century, Albrecht D\u00fcrer from Nuremberg established his reputation across Europe as painter, printmaker, mathematician, engraver, and theorist when he was still in his twenties and secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance.\n[4] Title: \"Graphic arts\" Text:  Using art alongside the carefully lettered text enhanced the religious reading experience. Johannes Gutenberg invented an improved movable type mechanical device known as the printing press in 1450, the first outside of Asia. His printing press facilitated the mass-production of text and graphic art and eventually, replaced manual transcriptions altogether. Again during the Renaissance years, graphic art in the form of printing played a major role in the spread of classical learning in Europe. Within these manuscripts, book designers focused heavily on typeface. Due to the development of larger fonts during the Industrial Revolution, posters became a popular form of graphic art used to communicate the latest information as well as to advertise the latest products and services.\n[5] Title: \"Johannes Gutenberg\" Text:  However, most specialists regard the occasional overlapping of type as caused by paper movement over pieces of type of slightly unequal height. Although Gutenberg was financially unsuccessful in his lifetime, the printing technologies spread quickly, and news and books began to travel across Europe much faster than before. It fed the growing Renaissance, and since it greatly facilitated scientific publishing, it was a major catalyst for the later scientific revolution. The capital of printing in Europe shifted to Venice, where visionary printers like Aldus Manutius ensured widespread availability of the major Greek and Latin texts.\nQuestion: who invented the printing press which helped spread the renaissance throughout europe\nYour answer: ",

Nora was portrayed by Myrna Loy. The title of both the book and the film referred to the murder victim, Clyde Wynant, that Nick is initially hired to find, but producers referred to \"\"The Thin Man\"\" in the titles of each of the sequel films for branding purposes. As a consequence \"\"The Thin Man\"\" was eventually elided by the public into an alias for the character of Nick Charles.\n[2] Title: \"The Thin Man (film)\" Text:  The Thin Man (film) The Thin Man is a 1934 American pre-Code comedy-mystery film directed by W. S. Van Dyke and based on the novel of the same name by Dashiell Hammett. The film stars William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles; Nick is a hard-drinking, retired private detective, and Nora is a wealthy heiress. Their wire-haired fox terrier Asta is played by canine actor Skippy. The film's screenplay was written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich, a married couple. In 1934, the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n[3] Title: \"Myrna Loy\" Text:  When gangster John Dillinger was shot to death after leaving a screening of the film at the Biograph Theater in Chicago, the film received widespread publicity, with some newspapers reporting that Loy had been Dillinger's favorite actress. After appearing with Ram\u00f3n Novarro in \"\"The Barbarian\"\" (1933), Loy was cast as Nora Charles in the 1934 film \"\"The Thin Man\"\". Director W. S. Van Dyke chose Loy after he detected a wit and sense of humor that her previous films had not revealed. At a Hollywood party, he pushed her into a swimming pool to test her reaction, and felt that her aplomb in handling the situation was exactly what he envisioned for Nora.\n[4] Title: \"Myrna Loy\" Text:  There, she began studying dance, and trained extensively throughout her high school education. She was discovered by production designer Natacha Rambova, who helped facilitate film auditions for her, and she began obtaining small roles in the late 1920s, mainly portraying vamps. Her role in \"\"The Thin Man\"\" helped elevate her reputation as a versatile actress, and she reprised the role of Nora Charles five more times. Loy's career began to slow in the 1940s, and she appeared in only a few films in the 1950s, including a lead role in the comedy \"\"Cheaper by the Dozen\"\" (1950), as well as supporting parts in \"\"The Ambassador's Daughter\"\" (1956) and the drama \"\"Lonelyhearts\"\" (1958).\n[5] Title: \"The Thin Man (TV series)\" Text:  Albertson played Lieutenant Harry Evans of the New York Police Department. Donahue played Hazel, Nick and Nora's neighbor. Talbot played Beatrice Dane, alias Blondie Collins, a criminal who dragged Nick and Nora into her schemes.

A newspaper columnist wrote that Nora Charles' role was different from that of other female leads in detective programs on television. Kirk commented:We were the first of the sophisticated detective dramas, and from the scripts it was simple to see that the part of Nora Charles was that of a leading lady who made more than token appearances.\nQuestion: who played nora charles in the thin man\nYour answer: ",

Later that month, the Grateful Dead played at the Trips Festival, an early psychedelic rock concert.\n[2] Title: \"Grateful Dead\" Text:  There have also been several spin-offs featuring one or more core members, such as Dead & Company, Furthur, the Rhythm Devils, Phil Lesh & Friends, RatDog, and Billy & the Kids. The Grateful Dead began their career as the Warlocks, a group formed in early 1965 from the remnants of a Palo Alto, California jug band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. The band's first show was at Magoo's Pizza located at 639 Santa Cruz Avenue in suburban Menlo Park, on May 5, 1965.\n[3] Title: \"Grateful Dead\" Text:  The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s.

Around 1965, McKernan urged the rest of the Warlocks to switch to electric instruments. Bassist Phil Lesh joined soon after, and they became the Grateful Dead. The group were keen to involve McKernan in the band, as he was the group's original leader and was considered the best singer and frontman. The Dead's early sets centered around blues and R&B covers chosen by McKernan. By the end of 1966, Garcia had improved his musical skills and wanted to assert himself more as a leader and musical director, changing the band's direction and reducing McKernan's contributions.\nQuestion: when did the warlocks became the grateful dead\nYour answer: ",

An amendment she offered established the \"\"Cash for Clunkers\"\" program. Sutton received wide media attention in 2009 as a result of her lead sponsorship of the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act, which mandated the \"\"Cash for Clunkers\"\" program that went into effect during the summer of 2009. Her 2010 Republican opponent, Tom Ganley, sold 876 cars under this program.\n[2] Title: \"Alan Blinder\" Text:  Blinder was an early advocate of a \"\"Cash for Clunkers\"\" program, in which the government buys some of the oldest, most-polluting vehicles and scraps them. In July 2008, he wrote an article in \"\"The New York Times\"\" advocating such a program, which was implemented by the Obama administration during the summer of 2009. Blinder asserted it could stimulate the economy, benefit the environment, and reduce income inequality. The program was praised by President Obama for \"\"exceeding expectations,\"\" but criticized for economic and environmental reasons.\n[3] Title: \"Barack Obama\" Text:  Obama intervened in the troubled automotive industry in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60% equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government taking a 12% stake. In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment. He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as \"\"Cash for Clunkers\"\", that temporarily boosted the economy.\n[4] Title: \"History of the United States\" Text:  Obama, like Bush, took steps to rescue the auto industry and prevent future economic meltdowns. These included a bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, putting ownership temporarily in the hands of the government, and the \"\"cash for clunkers\"\" program which temporarily boosted new car sales. The recession officially ended in June 2009, and the economy slowly began to expand once again.

Scarlett Johansson portrays the character Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff) in films as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Black Widow's first appearances were as a recurring, non-costumed, Russian-spy antagonist in the feature \"\"Iron Man\"\", beginning in \"\"Tales of Suspense\"\" #52 (April 1964). Five issues later, she recruits the besotted costumed archer and later superhero Hawkeye to her cause.\n[2] Title: \"Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)\" Text:  She eventually breaks free from her psychological conditioning (with the help of Hawkeye), and does successfully defect, having further adventures with Spider-Man, with Hawkeye and with Daredevil. She ultimately joins the Avengers as a costumed heroine herself. Later still, she begins freelancing as an agent of the international espionage group S.H.I.E.L.D. She is sent on a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. mission to China by Nick Fury. There, with the Avengers, she battles Col. Ling, Gen. Brushov, and her ex-husband the Red Guardian. For a time, as writer Les Daniels noted in a contemporaneous study in 1971, During her romantic involvement with Matt Murdock in San Francisco, she operates as an independent superhero alongside Murdock's alter ego, Daredevil.\n[3] Title: \"Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)\" Text:  Her government later supplies her with her first Black Widow costume and high-tech weaponry, but she eventually defects to the United States after appearing, temporarily brainwashed against the U.S., in the superhero-team series \"\"The Avengers\"\" #29 (July 1966). The Widow later becomes a recurring ally of the team before officially becoming its sixteenth member many years later. The Black Widow was visually updated in 1970: \"\"The Amazing Spider-Man\"\" #86 (July 1970) reintroduced her with shoulder-length red hair (instead of her former short black hair), a skintight black costume, and wristbands which fired spider threads.\n[4] Title: \"Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)\" Text:  Afterward, the registered Natasha joins the reconstituted Avengers. S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury is presumed killed, and deputy director Maria Hill incapacitated, so Natasha assumes temporary command of S.H.I.E.L.D. as the highest-ranking agent present. Later, Tony Stark assigns Natasha to convey the late Captain America's shield to a secure location, but is intercepted by her former lover, Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier, who steals the shield. Natasha and the Falcon then rescue Barnes from the Red Skull's minions, and bring him to the S.H.I.E.L.D.\n[5] Title: \"Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)\" Text:  The pair almost succeeded, but when Black Widow was injured, Hawkeye retreated to get her to safety.

When her employers learned the truth, the KGB had her gunned down, sending her to a hospital, convincing Hawkeye to go straight and seek membership in the Avengers.

The series revolves around a fictional version of the pair as they try to achieve success as a band in New York City and try to develop an American fan base. The regular cast includes fellow comedians Rhys Darby as Murray, Arj Barker as Dave, and Kristen Schaal as their obsessed fan Mel. This show also features many other comedians in guest starring roles. Their songs are woven into the plot of each episode.\n[4] Title: \"Rhys Darby\" Text:  After performing his first solo show at the 2002 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Darby moved to the UK to pursue his career further. In 2004 he appeared in the Flight of the Conchords BBC radio series as the band's manager Brian Nesbit alongside comedy stars such as Rob Brydon, Andy Parsons and Jimmy Carr.

Starting in 1940 (18 months before Pearl Harbor), the nation mobilized, giving high priority to air power. American involvement in World War II in 1940\u201341 was limited to providing war material and financial support to Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Republic of China. The U.S. entered officially on 8 December 1941 following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Japanese forces soon seized American, Dutch, and British possessions across the Pacific and Southeast Asia, except for Australia, which became a main American forward base along with Hawaii.\n[2] Title: \"World War II by country\" Text:  The United States joined the Allies in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan.Germany and Italy declared war on the United States three days later. The United States subscribed to the Allied plan of making German defeat the priority, coordinating with the United Kingdom in most major operations. However, it also maintained a strong effort against Japan, being the primary Allied power in the Pacific Theater. The U.S. supplied valuable industrial production as the Arsenal of Democracy. After the war the United States retained military commitments to European security while providing economic investment to rebuild nations devastated during the war.\n[3] Title: \"Military history of the United States during World War II\" Text:  The Germans were joined by submarines of the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) after their Axis ally Italy entered the war on June 10, 1940. The United States entered the war in the west with Operation Torch on 8 November 1942, after their Soviet allies had pushed for a second front against the Germans. General Dwight Eisenhower commanded the assault on North Africa, and Major General George Patton struck at Casablanca. The United States did not have a smooth entry into the war against Nazi Germany. Early in 1943, the U.S. Army suffered a near-disastrous defeat at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass in February.\n[4] Title: \"Military history of the United States during World War II\" Text:  Military history of the United States during World War II The military history of the United States in World War II covers the war against Germany, Italy, and Japan, starting with the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. During the first two years of World War II, the United States had maintained formal neutrality as made official in the Quarantine Speech delivered by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1937, while supplying Britain, the Soviet Union, and China with war materiel through the Lend-Lease Act which was signed into law on 11 March 1941, as well as deploying the U.S. military to replace the British invasion forces in Iceland.\n[5] Title: \"Military history of the United States during World War II\" Text:  The year 1940 marked a change in attitude in the United States. The German victories in France, Poland and elsewhere, combined with the Battle of Britain, led many Americans to believe that the United States would be forced to fight soon. In March 1941, the Lend-Lease program began shipping money, munitions, and food to Britain, China, and (by that fall) the Soviet Union. By 1941 the United States was taking an active part in the war, despite its nominal neutrality. In spring U-boats began their \"\"wolf-pack\"\" tactics which threatened to sever the trans- Atlantic supply line; Roosevelt extended the Pan-American Security Zone east almost as far as Iceland.\nQuestion: when did the united states get involved in world war ii\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Reserved powers\" Text:  In Australia, despite the centralized nature of the constitution, the High Court adopted the \"\"reserved powers doctrine\"\" which was used until 1920 to preserved as much autonomy for the states as can be interpreted from the constitution. This practice changed with the Engineers' Case which led reserved powers to be given to the Commonwealth. Other countries whose legal system is based on common law, such as India, Israel, and Ireland, have similar legal frameworks of reserved powers. Reserved powers Reserved powers, residual powers, or residuary powers are the powers which are neither prohibited nor explicitly given by law to any organ of government.\n[2] Title: \"Reserved powers doctrine\" Text:  Reserved powers doctrine The reserved powers doctrine was a principle used by the inaugural High Court of Australia in the interpretation of the Constitution of Australia, that emphasised the context of the Constitution, drawing on principles of federalism, what the Court saw as the compact between the newly formed Commonwealth and the former colonies, particularly the compromises that informed the text of the constitution. The doctrine involved a restrictive approach to the interpretation of the specific powers of the Federal Parliament to preserve the powers that were intended to be left to the States.\n[3] Title: \"Reserved powers doctrine\" Text:  The doctrine was challenged by the new appointments to the Court in 1906 and was ultimately abandoned by the High Court in 1920 in the \"\"Engineers' Case\"\", replaced by an approach to interpretation that emphasised the text rather than the context of the Constitution. The Constitution sets up the Commonwealth of Australia as a federal polity, with enumerated limited specific powers conferred on the Federal Parliament. The constitutional convention held in Adelaide in 1897, passed a resolution that, as the first condition for the creation of a federal government, \"\"the powers, privileges and territories of the several existing colonies shall remain intact, except in respect of such surrenders as may be agreed upon to secure uniformity of law and administration in matters of common concern.\"\"\n[4] Title: \"Reserved powers doctrine\" Text:  The essence of the first part of the doctrine was that grants of power to the Commonwealth in the Constitution should be read in a restrictive way so as to preserve areas that had been intentionally left as the responsibility of the states, particularly where the Commonwealth power had an interstate element, the trade and commerce power, and the conciliation and arbitration power. The three inaugural judges of the High Court, Griffith CJ, Barton and O'Connor JJ, and the two new judges appointed in 1906, Isaacs and Higgins JJ, had been leading participants in the Constitutional Conventions and all are properly seen as among the framers of the Constitution.\n[5] Title: \"Australian constitutional law\" Text:  Reserved state powers holds that the Constitution should be read in a restrictive way so as to preserve as much autonomy as possible for the States. Implied intergovernmental immunities holds that Commonwealth and States are immune to each other's laws and cannot mutually regulate each other's governmental apparatus. In 1920, the Engineer's case (after changes in the composition of the Court) swept away this doctrine. The court now insisted on adhering only to interpreting a statute \"\"expounded according to the intent of the Parliament that made it; and that intention has to be found by an examination of the language used in the statute as a whole\"\".\nQuestion: where did the reserved powers find their constitutional mandate\nYour answer: ",

The standard writing pencil is graded \"\"HB\"\". This designation might have been first used in the early 20th century by Brookman, an English pencil maker. It used \"\"B\"\" for black and \"\"H\"\" for hard; a pencil's grade was described by a sequence or successive Hs or Bs such as \"\"BB\"\" and \"\"BBB\"\" for successively softer leads, and \"\"HH\"\" and \"\"HHH\"\" for successively harder ones.\n[2] Title: Pencil Text:  Two pencils of the same grade but different manufacturers will not necessarily make a mark of identical tone nor have the same hardness. Most manufacturers, and almost all in Europe, designate their pencils with the letters \"\"H\"\" (commonly interpreted as \"\"hardness\"\") to \"\"B\"\" (commonly \"\"blackness\"\"), as well as \"\"F\"\" (usually taken to mean \"\"fineness\"\", although F pencils are no more fine or more easily sharpened than any other grade.\n[3] Title: Pencil Text:  The Koh-i-Noor Hardtmuth pencil manufacturers claim to have first used the HB designations, with \"\"H\"\" standing for Hardtmuth, \"\"B\"\" for the company's location of Bud\u011bjovice, and \"\"F\"\" for Franz Hardtmuth, who was responsible for technological improvements in pencil manufacture. As of 2009, a set of pencils ranging from a very soft, black-marking pencil to a very hard, light-marking pencil usually ranges from softest to hardest as follows: Koh-i-noor offers twenty grades from 10H to 8B for its 1500 series; Mitsubishi Pencil offers twenty-two grades from 10H to 10B for its Hi-uni range; Derwent produces twenty grades from 9H to 9B for its graphic pencils and Staedtler produces sixteen from 6H to 8B for its Mars Lumograph pencils.\n[4] Title: Pencil Text:  Numbers as designation were first used by Cont\u00e9 and later by John Thoreau, father of Henry David Thoreau, in the 19th century. Although Cont\u00e9/Thoreau's equivalence table is widely accepted, not all manufacturers follow it; for example, Faber-Castell uses a different equivalence table in its \"\"Grip 2001\"\" pencils: 1 = 2B, 2 = B, 2\u00bd = HB, 3 = H, 4 = 2H. Graded pencils can be used for a rapid test that provides relative ratings for a series of coated panels but can't be used to compare the pencil hardness of different coatings.\n[5] Title: \"Brinell scale\" Text:  In former standards HB or HBS were used to refer to measurements made with steel indenters. HBW is calculated in both standards using the SI units as where: When quoting a Brinell hardness number (BHN or more commonly HB), the conditions of the test used to obtain the number must be specified. (HB is not related to the \"\"HB\"\" degree of pencil hardness.) The standard format for specifying tests can be seen in the example \"\"HBW 10/3000\"\". \"\"HBW\"\" means that a tungsten carbide (from the chemical symbol for tungsten or from the Swedish/German name for tungsten, \"\"Wolfram\"\") ball indenter was used, as opposed to \"\"HBS\"\", which means a hardened steel ball.\nQuestion: what does the b in hb pencil stand for\nYour answer: ",

The epistle says that Paul the Apostle and \"\"Sosthenes our brother\"\" wrote it to \"\"the church of God which is at Corinth\"\" although the scholarly consensus holds that Sosthenes was the amanuensis who wrote down the text of the letter at Paul's direction. Called \"\"a masterpiece of pastoral theology\"\", it addresses various issues that had arisen in the Christian community at Corinth.\n[2] Title: \"Second Epistle to the Corinthians\" Text:  Second Epistle to the Corinthians The Second Epistle to the Corinthians, often written as 2 Corinthians, is a Pauline epistle and the eighth book of the New Testament of the Bible. Paul the Apostle and \"\"Timothy \"\"our\"\" brother\"\" wrote this epistle to \"\"the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia\"\". While there is little doubt among scholars that Paul is the author, there is discussion over whether the Epistle was originally one letter or composed from two or more of Paul's letters.\n[3] Title: \"1 Corinthians 14\" Text:  Cross reference: . Paul writes \"\"In the law it is written\"\": The quotation comes from the book of Isaiah, \"\"but the term \"\"the Law\"\" was applied generally to the Old Testament\"\". 1 Corinthians 14 1 Corinthians 14 is the fourteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is authored by Paul the Apostle and Sosthenes in Ephesus. In this chapter, Paul writes about the gift of prophesy and about speaking in tongues.\n[4] Title: \"1 Corinthians 11\" Text:  1 Corinthians 11 1 Corinthians 11 is the eleventh chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It was authored by Paul the Apostle and Sosthenes in Ephesus. In this chapter, Paul writes on the conduct of Christians while worshiping together. The New King James Version organises this chapter as follows: New King James Version King James Version Theologian John Gill suggests that these words \"\"more properly close the preceding chapter, than begin a new one\"\", and many commentators agree.\n[5] Title: \"1 Corinthians 13\" Text:  1 Corinthians 13 1 Corinthians 13 is the thirteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians in the New Testament of the Christian Bible.

NBC elected to move the series to Sundays at 8:00 pm for its seventh season, a move universally regarded as the beginning of the series' end (since NBC and the NFL had reached a deal for Sunday Night Football to return to the network in fall 2006), and the series finale aired on May 14, 2006. \"\"The West Wing\"\" took a large ratings hit with the move, which put it up against ABC's Top 20 hit \"\"\"\", and CBS' Top 30 hit \"\"Cold Case\"\" in its timeslot.\n[2] Title: \"Twenty Five (The West Wing)\" Text:  Twenty Five (The West Wing) \"\"Twenty Five\"\" is the 88th episode and the season four finale of the American television series \"\"The West Wing\"\". It takes its title from the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which deals with the presidential line of succession. Continuing the storyline begun in the previous episode, a massive manhunt begins for President Bartlet's youngest daughter, Zoey, but the Secret Service's only clue is provided when Charlie Young remembers that Zoey's boyfriend, Jean-Paul, wanted her to take ecstasy at her graduation party.\n[3] Title: \"What Kind of Day Has It Been\" Text:  What Kind of Day Has It Been \"\"What Kind of Day Has It Been\"\" is the 22nd episode of \"\"The West Wing\"\", the season finale of the show's first season. It originally aired on NBC May 17, 2000. Events circle around the attempted rescue of a US fighter pilot in Iraq, and the president taking part in a town hall meeting in Rosslyn, Virginia. The episode was written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Thomas Schlamme. \"\"What Kind of Day Has It Been\"\" is also the name of the first-season finales of both the series \"\"Sports Night\"\" and \"\"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\"\", as well as the series finale of \"\"The Newsroom\"\", all of which were created by Aaron Sorkin.\n[4] Title: \"The West Wing\" Text:  A speed-up in \"\"The West Wing\"\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s timeline, in part due to the expiration of many cast members' contracts and a desire to continue the program with lower production costs, resulted in the omission of the 2004 midterm elections and an election during the seventh season.

The seven books are Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua and Judges. The first four of these are sometimes called the Tetrateuch, the first five are commonly known as the Torah or the Pentateuch, the first six as the Hexateuch. With the addition of the Book of Ruth, it becomes the Octateuch. The \"\"Enneateuch\"\" is the Heptateuch plus the Books of Samuel and the Books of Kings (each pair of books counted as one, and not including the Book of Ruth).\n[2] Title: Heptateuch Text:  Augustine of Hippo produced a piece called \"\"Questions on the Heptateuch\"\". \u00c6lfric of Eynsham produced an Old English version of the Heptateuch. Heptateuch The Heptateuch (seven containers) is a name sometimes given to the first seven books of the Hebrew Bible.

The first four of these are sometimes called the Tetrateuch, the first five are commonly known as the Torah or the Pentateuch, the first six as the Hexateuch. With the addition of the Book of Ruth, it becomes the Octateuch.\n[3] Title: Torah Text:  8:8, 18; 10:29\u201330; cf. 9:3). Christian scholars usually refer to the first five books of the Hebrew Bible as the \"\"Pentateuch\"\" (, \"\"pent\u00e1teuchos\"\", \"\"five scrolls\"\"), a term first used in the Hellenistic Judaism of Alexandria. The Torah starts from the beginning of God's creating the world, through the beginnings of the people of Israel, their descent into Egypt, and the giving of the Torah at biblical Mount Sinai. It ends with the death of Moses, just before the people of Israel cross to the promised land of Canaan.\n[4] Title: \"Law of Moses\" Text:  The text continues: The term occurs 15 times in the Hebrew Bible, a further 7 times in the New Testament, and repeatedly in Second Temple period, intertestamental, rabbinical and patristic literature. The Hebrew word for the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, \"\"Torah\"\" (which means \"\"law\"\" and was translated into Greek as \"\"nomos\"\" or \"\"Law\"\") refers to the same five books termed in English \"\"Pentateuch\"\" (from Latinised Greek \"\"five books,\"\" implying the five books of Moses).\n[5] Title: \"Law of Moses\" Text:  According to some scholars, use of the name \"\"Torah\"\" to designate the \"\"Five Books of Moses\"\" of the Hebrew Bible is clearly documented only from the 2nd century BCE. In modern usage, \"\"Torah\"\" can refer to the first five books of the Tanakh, as the Hebrew Bible is commonly called, to the instructions and commandments found in the 2nd to 5th books of the Hebrew Bible, and also to the entire Tanakh and even all of the Oral Law as well.\nQuestion: name for first 5 books of the bible\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Henry Moseley\" Text:  Moseley redefined the idea of atomic numbers from its previous status as an \"\"ad hoc\"\" numerical tag to help sorting the elements into an exact sequence of ascending atomic numbers that made the Periodic Table exact. (This was later to be the basis of the Aufbau principle in atomic studies.) As noted by Bohr, Moseley's law provided a reasonably complete experimental set of data that supported the (new from 1911) conception by Ernest Rutherford and Antonius van den Broek of the atom, with a positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons in which the atomic number is understood to be the exact physical number of positive charges (later discovered and called protons) in the central atomic nuclei of the elements.\n[2] Title: \"History of the periodic table\" Text:  Frederick Soddy in 1913 found that although they emitted different radiation, many elements were alike in their chemical characteristics so shared the same place on the table. They became known as isotopes, from the Greek \"\"\"\" (\"\"same place\"\"). In 1914, a year before he was killed in action at Gallipoli, the English physicist Henry Moseley found a relationship between the X-ray wavelength of an element and its atomic number. He was then able to re-sequence the periodic table by nuclear charge, rather than by atomic weight.\n[3] Title: \"History of chemistry\" Text:  In 1911, Antonius Van den Broek proposed the idea that the elements on the periodic table are more properly organized by positive nuclear charge rather than atomic weight. In 1911, the first Solvay Conference was held in Brussels, bringing together most of the most prominent scientists of the day. In 1912, William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg proposed Bragg's law and established the field of X-ray crystallography, an important tool for elucidating the crystal structure of substances. In 1912, Peter Debye develops the concept of molecular dipole to describe asymmetric charge distribution in some molecules.\n[4] Title: \"Periodic table\" Text:  The second decision was to occasionally ignore the order suggested by the atomic weights and switch adjacent elements, such as tellurium and iodine, to better classify them into chemical families. Mendeleev published in 1869, using atomic weight to organize the elements, information determinable to fair precision in his time. Atomic weight worked well enough to allow Mendeleev to accurately predict the properties of missing elements. Following the discovery, in 1911, by Ernest Rutherford of the atomic nucleus, it was proposed that the integer count of the nuclear charge is identical to the sequential place of each element in the periodic table.\n[5] Title: \"History of chemistry\" Text:  Mendeleev's law allowed him to build up a systematic periodic table of all the 66 elements then known based on atomic mass, which he published in \"\"Principles of Chemistry\"\" in 1869. His first Periodic Table was compiled on the basis of arranging the elements in ascending order of atomic weight and grouping them by similarity of properties. Mendeleev had such faith in the validity of the periodic law that he proposed changes to the generally accepted values for the atomic weight of a few elements and, in his version of the periodic table of 1871, predicted the locations within the table of unknown elements together with their properties.\nQuestion: who redefined the periodic table as being organized by atomic number not atomic weight\nYour answer: ",

By the end of 2015 the population increased to 599 inmates.\n[3] Title: \"Federal Prison Camp, Alderson\" Text:  In the 1920s, there was a shortage of federal prison space for female inmates. Women offenders either were given alternative punishments or were housed alone within all-male institutions. Prison staff and fellow inmates sexually exploited girls and women who were incarcerated in these facilities. Mabel Walker Willebrandt, the Assistant U.S. Attorney General, first encouraged establishment of a facility for women. FPC Alderson, which opened on April 30, 1927, as the Federal Industrial Institute for Women, was the first federal women's prison in the United States. It was opened during a reform movement in the 1920s to help reform female offenders.\n[4] Title: \"Alderson, West Virginia\" Text:  Alderson is the location of the Federal Reformatory for Women, opened in 1927, the first federal prison for women. During the early 1900s, Alderson became a hub of higher education in the state. It was home to three separate institutions of higher education, including the Alderson Academy and Junior College, which eventually was integrated into Alderson-Broaddus College in 1932. The Alexander McVeigh Miller House in Greenbrier County is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is Sunset Hill in Monroe County. The Alderson Bridge and Alderson Historic District are located in both counties.\n[5] Title: \"Monroe County, West Virginia\" Text:  The Federal Bureau of Prisons' Federal Prison Camp, Alderson was the first women's federal prison in the country. It is located in Monroe and Summers counties just west of Alderson. One of Monroe County's geological features is Haynes Cave, a former saltpeter mine. Strange bones were discovered by the miners at the end of the 18th Century, and mailed to Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson's study of the animal, the Megalonyx jeffersonii was arguably the birth of American paleontology.

When drawing the manga series, Kubo commented that Rukia Kuchiki, the first \"\"Bleach\"\" character he introduced, was originally intended to be the protagonist. Through subsequent development of the series, however, Kubo decided to make her a valued ally and instead introduced Ichigo as the central character.\n[2] Title: \"Tite Kubo\" Text:  In that program, Kubo was interviewed by Masakazu Morita, voice actor of Ichigo Kurosaki, the main character of \"\"Bleach\"\", and answered several questions from fans.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Patriot (American Revolution)\" Text:  The great majority of the Loyalists remained in America, while the minority went to Canada, Britain, Florida, or the West Indies. Historians have explored the motivations that pulled men to one side or the other. Yale historian Leonard Woods Labaree used the published and unpublished writings and letters of leading men on each side, searching for how personality shaped their choice. He finds eight characteristics that differentiated the two groups. Loyalists were older, better established, and more likely to resist innovation than the Patriots. Loyalists felt that the Crown was the legitimate government and resistance to it was morally wrong, while the Patriots felt that morality was on their side because the British government had violated the constitutional rights of Englishmen.\n[2] Title: \"American Revolution\" Text:  Both sides offered freedom and re-settlement to slaves who were willing to fight for them, recruiting slaves whose owners supported the opposing cause. Many black slaves sided with the Loyalists. Tens of thousands in the South used the turmoil of war to escape, and the southern plantation economies of South Carolina and Georgia especially were disrupted. During the Revolution, the British tried to turn slavery against the Americans. Historian David Brion Davis explains the difficulties with a policy of wholesale arming of the slaves: Davis underscored the British dilemma: \"\"Britain, when confronted by the rebellious American colonists, hoped to exploit their fear of slave revolts while also reassuring the large number of slave-holding Loyalists and wealthy Caribbean planters and merchants that their slave property would be secure\"\".\n[3] Title: \"American Revolution\" Text:  Free blacks in the North and South fought on both sides of the Revolution, but most fought for the Patriots. Gary Nash reports that there were about 9,000 black Patriots, counting the Continental Army and Navy, state militia units, privateers, wagoneers in the Army, servants to officers, and spies. Ray Raphael notes that thousands did join the Loyalist cause, but \"\"a far larger number, free as well as slave, tried to further their interests by siding with the patriots.\"\" Crispus Attucks was shot dead by British soldiers in the Boston Massacre in 1770 and is an iconic martyr to Patriots.\n[4] Title: \"African Americans\" Text:  By 1775, Africans made up 20% of the population in the American colonies, which made them the second largest ethnic group after the English. During the 1770s, Africans, both enslaved and free, helped rebellious English colonists secure American independence by defeating the British in the American Revolution. Africans and Englishmen fought side by side and were fully integrated. Blacks played a role in both sides in the American Revolution. Activists in the Patriot cause included James Armistead, Prince Whipple and Oliver Cromwell. In the Spanish Louisiana, Governor Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez organized Spanish free blackmen into two militia companies to defend New Orleans during the American Revolution.\n[5] Title: \"American Revolutionary War\" Text:  Members of the Mohawk nation fought on both sides. Many Tuscarora and Oneida sided with the colonists. The Continental Army sent the Sullivan Expedition on raids throughout New York to cripple the Iroquois tribes that had sided with the British. Mohawk leaders Joseph Louis Cook and Joseph Brant sided with the Americans and the British respectively, and this further exacerbated the split. Early in July 1776, a major action occurred in the fledgling conflict when the Cherokee allies of Britain attacked the western frontier areas of North Carolina. Their defeat resulted in a splintering of the Cherokee settlements and people, and was directly responsible for the rise of the Chickamauga Cherokee, bitter enemies of the Colonials who carried on a frontier war for decades following the end of hostilities with Britain.\nQuestion: what were the two sides of the american revolution\nYour answer: ",

However, the needs of Nigeria (then a British colony) far outstripped the productivity of the only university. In particular the University College at Ibadan had no faculty of engineering or technology, no law school, no pharmacy school or management training abilities. The Ashby commission, set up by the British, was to review tertiary education needs of the soon-to-be-independent nation of Nigeria. The government of the western region did not want to rely on the federal universities or those of other regions to admit its numerous secondary school leavers.\n[3] Title: \"University of Ibadan\" Text:  In September 2016, it became the first Nigerian university to make the top 1000 in Times Higher Education rankings.

Hannah, President of Michigan State University, USA. The university was fully autonomous, with the power to grant its own degrees.

The 1831 London Bridge was the last project of engineer John Rennie and was completed by his son, John Rennie the Younger. By 1962, the bridge was not sound enough to support the increased load of modern traffic, and it was sold by the City of London. The purchaser, Robert P. McCulloch, the chairman of McCulloch Oil Corporation, was the founder of Lake Havasu City, his retirement real estate development on the east shore of Lake Havasu, a large reservoir on the Colorado River.\n[4] Title: \"London Bridge\" Text:  The blocks were then shipped via the Panama Canal to California and trucked from Long Beach to Arizona. The bridge was reconstructed by Sundt Construction at Lake Havasu City, Arizona, and re-dedicated on 10 October 1971. The reconstruction of Rennie's London Bridge spans the Bridgewater Channel canal that leads from the Uptown area of Lake Havasu City and follows McCulloch Boulevard onto an island that has yet to be named. The London Bridge that was rebuilt at Lake Havasu City consists of a frame with stones from Rennie's London Bridge used as cladding.\n[5] Title: \"Lake Havasu City, Arizona\" Text:  The city was incorporated in 1978.

However, the franchise was revoked by the league at the end of the season when the Packers were revealed to have used college players in a game. As it turned out, the man who told the league of this was George Halas of the Chicago Staleys, who changed their name to the Bears the following year. This incident signaled the start of the infamous Packers-Bears rivalry.\n[4] Title: \"Green Bay Packers\" Text:  They have played over 100 games against each of those teams through history, and have a winning overall record against all of them, a distinction only shared with the Kansas City Chiefs and Dallas Cowboys.

On May 11, 2017, ABC renewed the series for a 22-episode seventh season. In February 2018, it was announced the seventh season would serve as the final season of the series. Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis conceived the show in 2004 before joining the writing staff of \"\"Lost\"\", but wanted to wait until that series was over to focus on this project. Eight years before the \"\"Once Upon a Time\"\" pilot (the two had just completed their work on \"\"Felicity\"\", in 2002), Kitsis and Horowitz became inspired to write fairy tales out of a love of \"\"mystery and excitement of exploring lots of different worlds.\"\"\n[2] Title: \"Once Upon a Time (TV series)\" Text:  Once Upon a Time (TV series) Once Upon a Time is an American fantasy drama television series on ABC which debuted on October 23, 2011, and concluded on May 18, 2018.

This was the name originally used in the comics for the home of Archie and his group of friends. Although set in the United States, just like the comics and said television series, the movie was shot entirely in British Columbia, Canada. The movie centers around Sabrina Sawyer, who is sent to live with her eccentric aunts in Riverdale.\n[2] Title: \"Sabrina Spellman\" Text:  When the police come to check the murder, the house disappears and the police are turned into goats. Sabrina Spellman is the main character in \"\"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\"\" set in the city of Greendale near Riverdale. Sabrina first appeared in a 1969 segment from Filmation's \"\"The Archie Comedy Hour\"\". She later appeared in her own Filmation half-hour series in 1971. Here she is created by Hilda and Zelda Spellman out of magic potions, as well as the accidental addition of teenage girls' stuff, due to being accidentally bumped by Zelda.\n[3] Title: \"Archie Comics\" Text:  \"\"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\"\" takes place in the 1960s in the neighboring town of Greendale, and follows a 16-year-old Sabrina Spellman as she struggles to balance her responsibilities as a witch-in-training, with her feeling for her boyfriend, Harvey Kinkle. On April 9, 2014, Archie Comics announced that the adult version of Archie Andrews featured in the \"\"Life with Archie\"\" series would die in issue #36 (July 2014), which would also be the second-to-last issue. Goldwater said Archie's final fate would be the same in both of the possible parallel futures covered by the series.\n[4] Title: \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" Text:  Sabrina was originally slated to debut in the show's season one finale, but this was eventually decided against, as showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa said it would've distracted from the rest of the episode, though she is still being considered for a later season. In September 2017, it was reported that a live-action television series based on the comic series \"\"The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\"\" was being developed for The CW by Warner Bros. Television and Berlanti Productions, with a planned release in the 2018-19 television season. The series would be a companion series to \"\"Riverdale\"\".\n[5] Title: \"Sabrina Spellman\" Text:  The adaptation will be a re-imagining of the origin and adventures of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, with a darker and more edgy story along the lines of the \"\"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\"\" comic series.

The United States played an ever-increasing role in supporting South Vietnam through the period. The U.S. had supported French forces in the First Indochina War, sent supplies and military advisers to South Vietnam throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, and eventually took over most of the fighting against both North Vietnam and the Viet Cong by the mid-1960s. By 1968, over 500,000 American troops were involved in the Vietnam War.\n[2] Title: \"Vietnam War\" Text:  U.S. involvement escalated in 1960 under President John F. Kennedy, with troop levels gradually surging under the MAAG program from just under a thousand in 1959 to 16,000 in 1963. By 1964 there were 23,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam, but this escalated further following the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, in which a U.S. destroyer was alleged to have clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft. In response the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution gave Lyndon B. Johnson authorization to increase U.S. military presence, deploying ground combat units for the first time and increasing troop levels to 184,000.\n[3] Title: \"Role of the United States in the Vietnam War\" Text:  The communists took full advantage of the situation and fueled anti-Di\u1ec7m sentiment to create further instability. On July 27, 1964, 5,000 additional U.S. military advisers were ordered to the Republic of Vietnam (RVN or South Vietnam), bringing the total American troop level to 21,000. Shortly thereafter an incident occurred off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) that was destined to escalate the conflict to new levels and lead to the full scale Americanization of the war. On the evening of August 2, 1964, the destroyer was conducting an electronic intelligence collection mission in international waters (even as claimed by North Vietnam) in the Gulf of Tonkin when it was attacked by three P-4 torpedo boats of the North Vietnamese Navy.\n[4] Title: \"Vietnam Era\" Text:  The period beginning on August 5, 1964 and ended on May 7, 1975 inclusive, in all other cases.\"\" The U.S. Congress, U.S. Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs elected to designate those years as such to accord special privileges to all persons who served the country's armed forces during that time. Similar designations have been made for other periods of war. The date August 5, 1964 is significant because it was the day of the start of U.S. bombing of North Vietnam at the Gulf of Tonkin.\n[5] Title: \"Role of the United States in the Vietnam War\" Text:  The US Government deployment of ground forces to Da Nang had not been consulted with the South Vietnamese government. Instead the initial deployment and gradual build-up was a unilateral decision by the US government. On May 5 the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade became the first U.S. Army ground unit committed to the conflict in South Vietnam. On August 18, Operation Starlite began as the first major U.S. ground operation, destroying an NLF stronghold in Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province. The North Vietnamese had already sent units of their regular army into southern Vietnam beginning in late 1964.\nQuestion: when did the us enter the viet nam war\nYour answer: ",

It reflects his feeling that the camaraderie that had served the band was, by then, largely absent. The album begins with a long instrumental preamble and segues into the lyrics for \"\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\"\", a tribute to Syd Barrett, whose mental breakdown had forced him to leave the group seven years earlier. Barrett is fondly recalled with lines such as \"\"Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun\"\" and \"\"You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon\"\".\n[5] Title: \"Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)\" Text:  As with their previous album \"\"The Dark Side of the Moon\"\" (1973), Pink Floyd used studio effects and synthesizers, and brought in guest singers: Roy Harper, who provided the lead vocals on \"\"Have a Cigar\"\", and Venetta Fields, who added backing vocals to \"\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\"\". \"\"Wish You Were Here\"\" topped record charts in the United Kingdom and the United States, and Harvest Records' parent company EMI was unable to print enough copies to meet demand.\nQuestion: what pink floyd album is wish you were here on\nYour answer: ",

Each year, Hutchinson hosts the Kansas State Fair, and National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Basketball Tournament. It is the home of the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center aerospace museum and Strataca (formerly known as Kansas Underground Salt Museum).\n[3] Title: \"Wichita, Kansas\" Text:  The two most notable residential areas of Wichita are Riverside and College Hill. Riverside is northwest of downtown, across the Arkansas River, and surrounds the Riverside Park. College Hill is east of downtown, south of Wichita State University. It is one of the more historic neighborhoods, along with Delano on the west side and Midtown in the north-central city. In terms of population, Wichita is the largest city in Kansas and the 48th largest city in the United States. It is racially more similar to the rest of the United States than any other major city.\n[4] Title: \"Wichita, Kansas\" Text:  The city lies on the Arkansas River near the western edge of the Flint Hills in the Wellington-McPherson Lowlands region of the Great Plains. The area's topography is characterized by the broad alluvial plain of the Arkansas River valley and the moderately rolling slopes that rise to the higher lands on either side. The Arkansas follows a winding course, south-southeast through Wichita, roughly bisecting the city. It is joined along its course by several tributaries all of which flow generally south. The largest is the Little Arkansas River, which enters the city from the north and joins the Arkansas immediately west of downtown.\n[5] Title: \"Arkansas River\" Text:  The river valley then expands as it encounters much flatter land beginning just west of Little Rock, Arkansas. It continues eastward across the plains and forests of eastern Arkansas until it flows into the Mississippi River. Water flow in the Arkansas River (as measured in central Kansas) has dropped from approximately 248 cubic feet per second (7 m\u00b3/s) average from 1944-1963 to 53 cubic feet per second (1.5 m\u00b3/s) average from 1984\u20132003, largely because of the pumping of groundwater for irrigation in eastern Colorado and western Kansas. Important cities along the Arkansas River include Pueblo, Colorado; Garden City, Kansas; Dodge City, Kansas; Wichita, Kansas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Fort Smith, Arkansas; and Little Rock, Arkansas.\nQuestion: the largest city in kansas on the arkansas river\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Dust Bowl\" Text:  The drought and erosion of the Dust Bowl affected that centered on the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and touched adjacent sections of New Mexico, Colorado, and Kansas. The Dust Bowl forced tens of thousands of poverty-stricken families to abandon their farms, unable to pay mortgages or grow crops, and losses reached $25 million per day by 1936 (). Many of these families, who were often known as \"\"Okies\"\" because so many of them came from Oklahoma, migrated to California and other states to find that the Great Depression had rendered economic conditions there little better than those they had left.\n[2] Title: Oklahoma Text:  By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state. During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl.\n[3] Title: \"Great Plains\" Text:  The region roughly centered on the Oklahoma Panhandle, including southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, the Texas Panhandle, and extreme northeastern New Mexico was known as the Dust Bowl during the late 1920s and early 1930s. The effect of an extended drought, inappropriate cultivation, and financial crises of the Great Depression, forced many farmers off the land throughout the Great Plains. From the 1950s on, many areas of the Great Plains have become productive crop-growing areas because of extensive irrigation on large landholdings. The United States is a major exporter of agricultural products.\n[4] Title: \"South Dakota\" Text:  A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced what was known as the Dust Bowl in South Dakota and several other plains states. Fertile topsoil was blown away in massive dust storms, and several harvests were completely ruined. The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with local bank foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state. The population of South Dakota declined by more than 7% between 1930 and 1940. Economic stability returned with the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, when demand for the state's agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war.\n[5] Title: \"Dust Bowl\" Text:  On November 11, 1933, a very strong dust storm stripped topsoil from desiccated South Dakota farmlands in just one of a series of severe dust storms that year. Beginning on May 9, 1934, a strong, two-day dust storm removed massive amounts of Great Plains topsoil in one of the worst such storms of the Dust Bowl. The dust clouds blew all the way to Chicago, where they deposited 12 million pounds of dust (~ 5500 tonnes). Two days later, the same storm reached cities to the east, such as Cleveland, Buffalo, Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C. That winter (1934\u20131935), red snow fell on New England.\nQuestion: what states were hit the hardest by the dust bowl\nYour answer: ",

The computer was announced in May 1960. The first customer delivery was in 1962, a 1301 sold to the University of London. About 150 to 200 of these machines were sold. One of their main attractions was that they performed British currency calculations (pounds, shillings and pence) in hardware. They also had the advantage of programmers not having to learn binary or octal arithmetic as the instruction set was pure decimal and the arithmetic unit had no binary mode, only decimal or pounds, shillings and pence.\n[5] Title: \"History of computing hardware\" Text:  This was the first business to go live on a stored program computer. In June 1951, the UNIVAC I (Universal Automatic Computer) was delivered to the U.S. Census Bureau. Remington Rand eventually sold 46 machines at more than US$1 million each ($ as of 2019). UNIVAC was the first \"\"mass produced\"\" computer. It used 5,200 vacuum tubes and consumed 125 kW of power. Its primary storage was serial-access mercury delay lines capable of storing 1,000 words of 11 decimal digits plus sign (72-bit words).\nQuestion: when were computers first sold to the public\nYour answer: ",

The second series was only transmitted once even though the BBC had paid to show it twice. Moffat feels that the delay damaged the series because such bad scheduling hinders returning audiences and that the two-year gap meant that it seemed as if Mark \"\"had been banging on about this sodding divorce for an awfully long time!\"\" After winning the Montreux award it seemed inevitable that the show would get a third series.\n[3] Title: Spaced Text:  The first series of the show, comprising seven episodes, premiered in the UK on Channel 4 24 September 1999, and the second and final series, also consisting of seven episodes, premiered on 23 February 2001 before concluding on 13 April, with the final episode of the second series also serving as the series finale.

An Italian cartographer traveling with him created the first map of the Ohio River. La Salle claimed the Ohio Valley for France. In 1749, Great Britain established the Ohio Company to settle and trade in the area. Exploration of the territory and trade with the Indians in the region near the Forks brought British colonials from both Pennsylvania and Virginia across the mountains,and both colonies claimed the territory.

The first documented European visitors to the Ohio River Valley and this area were French trappers and priests in the early and mid-1700s. They were impressed with the river's heavily wooded and hilly shores, and with the abundance of fish and wildlife.

This group appears to be most closely related to the slate-colored fox sparrows, but it is altogether likely to represent the basalmost divergence of the fox sparrow clade.\n[2] Title: \"Red fox sparrow\" Text:  Red fox sparrow Red fox sparrow is the collective name for the most brightly colored taxa in the American sparrow genus \"\"Passerella\"\", the \"\"Passerella iliaca iliaca\"\" group.

Within \"\"Vulpes\"\", 12 separate and distinct extant species and four fossil species are described: The Arctic fox is sometimes included in this genus as \"\"Vulpes lagopus\"\" based on the definitive mammal taxonomy list, as well as genetic evidence. Foxes of this group (including the fennec and Arctic foxes) possess eyes with pupils that retract into vertical slits in bright light. The red fox, Ruppell's fox, and Tibetan sand fox possess white-tipped tails.\n[4] Title: Holarctic Text:  The red fox (\"\"Vulpes vulpes\"\") is a highly adaptable predator. It has the widest distribution of any terrestrial carnivore, and is adapted to a wide range of habitats, including areas of intense human development. Like the wolf, it is distributed throughout the majority of the Holarctic, but it has avoided extirpation. The wolverine (\"\"Gulo gulo\"\") is a large member of the weasel family found primarily in the arctic and in boreal forests, ranging south in mountainous regions. It is distributed in such areas throughout Eurasia and North America.\n[5] Title: \"Domesticated red fox\" Text:  Domesticated red fox The Russian domesticated red fox is a form of the wild red fox (\"\"Vulpes vulpes\"\") which has been domesticated to an extent, under laboratory conditions. They are the result of an experiment which was designed to demonstrate the power of selective breeding to transform species, as described by Charles Darwin in \"\"On the Origin of Species\"\". The experiment was purposely designed to replicate the process that had produced dogs from wolves, by recording the changes in foxes, when in each generation only the most tame foxes were allowed to breed.\nQuestion: what is the scientific name for a red fox\nYour answer: ",

The series was filmed beginning in 1983 in areas including Norfolk, Devon, Oxfordshire and Barbados. The town of Nether Wallop, Hampshire doubled as Miss Marple's home village of St. Mary Mead. Slater was replaced by producer George Gallaccio starting with the fourth film. Hickson vowed not to do another film after 1989's \"\"A Caribbean Mystery\"\", but was persuaded to return for the final two films in 1991 and 1992. \"\"A Caribbean Mystery\"\" was shot on location at the Coral Reef Hotel in Barbados, where Christie had stayed in her visit to the country, and which had been the inspiration for the setting of the novel.\n[2] Title: \"Agatha Christie's Marple\" Text:  Fawley Court in Buckinghamshire was used as Stoneygates in \"\"They Do It with Mirrors\"\" and The Grotto was used as the exterior of the secret folly in \"\"Endless Night\"\".

The beach scenes were shot at Boulders Beach. Scenes were filmed in Dorchester for \"\"Endless Night\"\".\n[3] Title: \"A Caribbean Mystery\" Text:  Few changes were made from the novel: the Prescotts and Se\u00f1ora de Caspearo were omitted, Miss Marple holidayed on Barbados rather than the fictional island of \"\"St Honor\u00e9\"\" (the name Honor\u00e9 reappears as the fictional main town in the BBC series \"\"Death in Paradise\"\" that began airing in 2011), and the blood pressure medication was renamed Tetrauwolfide. The production was made and aired after the production of \"\"Nemesis\"\", leading to some viewer confusion. In the earlier production, the part of Jason Rafiel was portrayed by Frank Gatliff, rather than Donald Pleasence.\n[4] Title: \"A Caribbean Mystery\" Text:  Two of the major characters reappear in the novel \"\"Nemesis\"\", published in 1971.

It only reached No. 67 in the US in 1970, but was later a bigger hit there for her in a live version released in 1974, which peaked at No.\n[2] Title: \"Big Yellow Taxi\" Text:  24. Charting versions have also been recorded by The Neighborhood (who had the original top US 40 hit with the track in 1970, peaking at No. 29), Maire Brennan, Amy Grant and Counting Crows. Mitchell said this about writing the song to journalist Alan McDougall in the early 1970s: The song is known for its environmental concern \u2013 \"\"They paved paradise to put up a parking lot\"\" and \"\"Hey farmer, farmer, put away that DDT now\"\" \u2013 and sentimental sound.\n[3] Title: \"Big Yellow Taxi\" Text:  In many covers the departed one may be interpreted as variously a boyfriend, a husband or a father. The literal interpretation is that he is walking out on the singer by taking a taxi; otherwise it is assumed he is being taken away by the authorities. Mitchell's original recording was first released as a single and then, as stated above, included on her 1970 album \"\"Ladies of the Canyon.\"\" A later live version was released in 1974 (1975 in France and Spain) and reached No.\n[4] Title: \"Big Yellow Taxi\" Text:  The line \"\"They took all the trees, and put 'em in a tree museum / And charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em\"\" refers to Foster Botanical Garden in downtown Honolulu, which is a living museum of tropical plants, some rare and endangered. In the song's final verse, the political gives way to the personal. Mitchell recounts the departure of her \"\"old man\"\" in the eponymous \"\"big yellow taxi,\"\" which may refer to the old Metro Toronto Police patrol cars, which until 1986 were painted yellow.\n[5] Title: \"Big Yellow Taxi\" Text:  Bob Dylan, instead of singing about the \"\"big yellow taxi\"\" that \"\"took away my old man,\"\" sings, \"\"A big yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.\"\" Similarly, in Mitchell's live version of the song released on \"\"Miles of Aisles\"\" in 1974, she sings about \"\"a big yellow tractor\"\" that \"\"pushed around my house, pushed around my land.\"\" She then repeats the same verse, but with the original lyrics.\nQuestion: when was the song big yellow taxi written\nYour answer: ",

It may be an ion, such as a molecule or atom with a surplus or deficit of electrons relative to protons. It can be the electrons and protons themselves, as well as other elementary particles, like positrons. It may also be an atomic nucleus devoid of electrons, such as an alpha particle, a helium nucleus. Neutrons have no charge. A plasma is a collection of charged particles, atomic nuclei and separated electrons, but can also be a gas containing a significant proportion of charged particles.\n[2] Title: \"Charged particle\" Text:  Plasma is called the fourth state of matter because its properties are quite different from solids, liquids and gases. Charged particle In physics, a charged particle is a particle with an electric charge. It may be an ion, such as a molecule or atom with a surplus or deficit of electrons relative to protons. It can be the electrons and protons themselves, as well as other elementary particles, like positrons. It may also be an atomic nucleus devoid of electrons, such as an alpha particle, a helium nucleus.\n[3] Title: \"Electric charge\" Text:  An \"\"ion\"\" is an atom (or group of atoms) that has lost one or more electrons, giving it a net positive charge (cation), or that has gained one or more electrons, giving it a net negative charge (anion). \"\"Monatomic ions\"\" are formed from single atoms, while \"\"polyatomic ions\"\" are formed from two or more atoms that have been bonded together, in each case yielding an ion with a positive or negative net charge. During formation of macroscopic objects, constituent atoms and ions usually combine to form structures composed of neutral \"\"ionic compounds\"\" electrically bound to neutral atoms.\n[4] Title: Chemistry Text:  'microscopic chemical events'). An \"\"ion\"\" is a charged species, an atom or a molecule, that has lost or gained one or more electrons. When an atom loses an electron and thus has more protons than electrons, the atom is a positively charged ion or cation. When an atom gains an electron and thus has more electrons than protons, the atom is a negatively charged ion or anion. Cations and anions can form a crystalline lattice of neutral salts, such as the Na and Cl ions forming sodium chloride, or NaCl.\n[5] Title: Atom Text:  Every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more protons and typically a similar number of neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.\nQuestion: what is the term for a charged atom\nYour answer: ",

Andrew Jackson is notable as the first U.S. President to be elected from the frontier rather than from the East Coast. The Democratic Party split along regional lines for the first time in 1860 over slavery. This split between southern and northern factions led to a brand new party in 1854, the Republican Party and its candidate Abraham Lincoln being elected in 1860. The Civil War followed shortly thereafter. In 1865, the 13th Amendment\u2014abolishing slavery\u2014became part of the Constitution when it was ratified by three-quarters of the states.\n[2] Title: \"Woodrow Wilson\" Text:  Wilson was the first Democrat other than Grover Cleveland to be elected president since 1856, and he recognized his party's need for high-level federal patronage. He worked closely with Southern Democrats. In Wilson's first month in office, Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson brought up the issue of racially segregating workplaces in a cabinet meeting and urged the president to establish this policy across the government, in restrooms, cafeterias and work spaces. Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo also permitted lower-level officials to racially segregate employees in the workplaces of those departments.\n[3] Title: \"Separation of powers under the United States Constitution\" Text:  Some believed that the president would become a mere figurehead, with the Speaker of the House of Representatives becoming a \"\"de facto\"\" prime minister. Grover Cleveland, the first Democratic President following Johnson, attempted to restore the power of his office. During his first term, he vetoed over 400 bills\u2014twice as many bills as his 21 predecessors combined. He also began to suspend bureaucrats who were appointed as a result of the patronage system, replacing them with more \"\"deserving\"\" individuals. The Senate, however, refused to confirm many new nominations, instead demanding that Cleveland turn over the confidential records relating to the suspensions.\n[4] Title: \"Grover Cleveland\" Text:  Cleveland was the first Democratic President subject to the Tenure of Office Act which originated in 1867; the act purported to require the Senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its advice and consent. Cleveland objected to the act in principle and his steadfast refusal to abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887. Cleveland faced a Republican Senate and often resorted to using his veto powers. He vetoed hundreds of private pension bills for American Civil War veterans, believing that if their pensions requests had already been rejected by the Pension Bureau, Congress should not attempt to override that decision.\n[5] Title: Mugwumps Text:  Blaine was from the reform wing of his own party, but the Mugwumps rejected his candidacy. This division among Republicans may have contributed to the victory in 1884 of Grover Cleveland, the first president elected from the Democratic party since the Civil War. In the period from 1876 to 1892, presidential elections were closely contested at the national level, but the states themselves were mostly dominated by a single party, with Democrats prevailing in the South and the Republicans in the Northeast. Although the defection of the Mugwumps may have helped Cleveland win in New York, one of the few closely contested states, historians attribute Cleveland's victory nationwide to the rising power of urban immigrant voters.\nQuestion: who was the first president identified as a democrat\nYour answer: ",

The third film was the first to extensively utilise real-life locations, as much of the first two films had been shot in the studio. Some sets for the film were built in Glen Coe, Scotland, near the Clachaig Inn. The indoor sets, including ones built for the previous two films, are mainly in Leavesden Film Studios. The Hogwarts Lake was filmed from Loch Shiel, Loch Eilt and Loch Morar in the Scottish Highlands.\n[2] Title: \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)\" Text:  Incidentally, the train bridge, which was also featured in the \"\"Chamber of Secrets\"\", is opposite Loch Shiel and was used to film the sequences when the Dementor boarded the train. A small section of the triple-decker bus scene, where it weaves in between traffic, was filmed in North London's Palmers Green. Some parts were also filmed in and around Borough Market and Lambeth Bridge in London. Hogwarts grew and expanded significantly with the third film. For the first time, the Hogwarts courtyard and bridge were seen.\n[3] Title: \"Glen Coe\" Text:  Sets for the third \"\"Harry Potter\"\" film, \"\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\"\", were built near to the bottom of Clachaig Gully, north of the Clachaig Inn. There are also some shots of the eastern glen, including Buachaille Etive M\u00f2r in the Bollywood film \"\"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\"\", and in the James Bond film \"\"Skyfall\"\" (which was mainly filmed in Glen Etive). There is a folk museum in Glencoe village. Other than a few scattered farms, the only settlement in Glen Coe is the village of Glencoe, which lies at the western end of the glen close to Invercoe where the river joins Loch Leven.\n[4] Title: \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)\" Text:  At the end of the bridge, rock monoliths were placed onto the hillside to evoke a Celtic feeling. The use of live-action also significantly changed the look of Hagrid's hut. In the first two films, it appeared at the end of a flat stretch, right in front of the Forbidden Forest. The third film utilised the more rugged Scottish locations to place Hagrid's hut at the bottom of a steep hillside. A large pumpkin patch was added behind the hut. The Honeydukes set in this film is a redress of the set of Flourish & Blotts that was seen in \"\"Chamber of Secrets\"\", which, in turn, was a redress of the Ollivanders set from the first film.\n[5] Title: \"Lochaber High School\" Text:  In May and June 2003 90 pupils were extras in the film \"\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\"\", the third Harry Potter film, but any fees paid to them on a school day went into Lochaber High School's account. This was around \u00a32,500 in total. Filming took place in Glencoe.

The S&P 500 index components and their weightings are determined by S&P Dow Jones Indices. It differs from other U.S. stock market indices, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the NASDAQ Composite index, because of its diverse constituency and weighting methodology.\n[2] Title: \"S&P 500 Index\" Text:  Three years later in 1926, the Composite Index expanded to 90 stocks and then in 1957 it expanded to its current 500. In 1941, Poor's Publishing (Henry Varnum Poor's original company) merged with Standard Statistics (founded in 1906 as the Standard Statistics Bureau) and therein assumed the name Standard and Poor's Corporation. Its primary daily stock market index was the \"\"S&P 90\"\", a value-weighted index based on 90 stocks. Standard & Poor's also published a weekly index of the stocks of 425 industrial companies.\n[3] Title: \"S&P 500 Index\" Text:  David M. Blitzer has overall responsibility for index security selection. The S&P 500 is a capitalization-weighted index, and is associated with many ticker symbols, such as: ^GSPC, INX, and $SPX, depending on market or website. Standard & Poor's, a company that provides financial information and analysis, was founded in 1860 by Henry Varnum Poor. The \"\"Composite Index\"\", as the S&P 500 was first called when it introduced its first stock index in 1923, began tracking a small number of stocks.\n[4] Title: \"S&P 500 Index\" Text:  The S&P 500 index in its present form began on March 4, 1957. Technology has allowed the index to be calculated and disseminated in real time. The S&P 500 is widely used as a measure of the general level of stock prices, as it includes both growth stocks and value stocks. In September 1962, Ultronic Systems Corp. entered into an agreement with Standard and Poor's. Under the terms of this agreement, Ultronics computed the S&P 500 Stock Composite Index, the 425 Stock Industrial Index, the 50 Stock Utility Index, and the 25 Stock Rail Index.\n[5] Title: \"S&P 500 Index\" Text:  Standard & Poor's now calculates the market capitalization of each company relevant to the index using only the number of shares available for public trading (called the \"\"float\"\"). The index has traditionally been capitalization-weighted; that is, movements in the prices of stocks with higher market capitalizations (the \"\"share price\"\" times the \"\"number of shares outstanding\"\") had a greater impact on the value of the index than do companies with smaller market caps. The transition to float-adjusted capitalization-weighting was made in two steps, the first on March 18, 2005 and the second on September 16, 2005.\nQuestion: what is the standard and poor 's 500 index\nYour answer: ",

As a result, the first official settlement was not established within Canada until the founding of Quebec by Samuel de Champlain in 1608. The other four colonies within New France were Hudson's Bay to the north, Acadia and Newfoundland to the east, and Louisiana far to the south. Canada, the most developed colony of New France, was divided into three districts, Qu\u00e9bec, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, and Montr\u00e9al, each with its own government.\n[2] Title: \"New France\" Text:  Much of what transpired between the indigenous population and their European visitors around that time is not known, for lack of historical records. Other attempts at establishing permanent settlements were also failures. In 1598, a French trading post was established on Sable Island, off the coast of Acadia, but was unsuccessful. In 1600, a trading post was established at Tadoussac, but only five settlers survived the winter. In 1604, a settlement was founded at \u00cele-Saint-Croix on Baie Fran\u00e7ois (Bay of Fundy), which was moved to Port-Royal in 1605.\n[3] Title: \"New France\" Text:  It was abandoned in 1607, re-established in 1610, and destroyed in 1613, after which settlers moved to other nearby locations, creating settlements that were collectively known as Acadia, and the settlers as Acadians. In 1608, sponsored by Henry IV, Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons and Samuel de Champlain founded the city of Quebec with 28 men, the second permanent French settlement in the colony of Canada. Colonization was slow and difficult. Many settlers died early because of harsh weather and diseases. In 1630, there were only 103 colonists living in the settlement, but by 1640, the population had reached 355.\n[4] Title: \"New France\" Text:  (after 1717, extending north through the Illinois Country); Thus, it extended from Newfoundland to the Canadian prairies and from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico, including all the Great Lakes of North America. In the sixteenth century, the lands were used primarily to draw from the wealth of natural resources such as furs through trade with the various indigenous peoples. In the seventeenth century, successful settlements began in Acadia, and in Quebec by the efforts of Champlain. By 1765, the population of the new Province of Quebec reached approximately 70,000 settlers.\n[5] Title: \"History of Quebec\" Text:  By the end of the 17th century, a census showed that around 10,000 French settlers were farming along the lower St. Lawrence Valley. By 1700, fewer than 20,000 people of French origin were settled in New France, extending from Newfoundland to the Mississippi, with the pattern of settlement following the networks of the cod fishery and fur trade, although most Quebec settlers were farmers. Modern Quebec was part of the territory of New France, the general name for the North American possessions of France until 1763. At its largest extent, before the Treaty of Utrecht, this territory included several colonies, each with its own administration: Canada, Acadia, Hudson Bay, and Louisiana.\nQuestion: where did most settlements exist in new france\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Bird Text:  Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird's flight style and performance; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight.\n[2] Title: Skeleton Text:  The bird skeleton is highly adapted for flight. It is extremely lightweight, yet still strong enough to withstand the stresses of taking off, flying, and landing. One key adaptation is the fusing of bones into single ossifications, such as the pygostyle. Because of this, birds usually have a smaller number of bones than other terrestrial vertebrates. Birds also lack teeth or even a true jaw, instead having evolved a beak, which is far more lightweight. The beaks of many baby birds have a projection called an egg tooth, which facilitates their exit from the amniotic egg.\n[3] Title: \"Bird anatomy\" Text:  One key adaptation is the fusing of bones into single ossifications, such as the pygostyle. Because of this, birds usually have a smaller number of bones than other terrestrial vertebrates. Birds also lack teeth or even a true jaw, and instead have a beak, which is far more lightweight. The beaks of many baby birds have a projection called an egg tooth, which facilitates their exit from the amniotic egg, which falls off once it has done its job. The vertebral column is divided into five sections of vertebrae: The neck of a bird is composed of 13\u201325 cervical vertebrae enabling birds to have increased flexibility.\n[4] Title: Bird Text:  Some species, including cattle egret, yellow-headed caracara and galah, have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat. Compared with other vertebrates, birds have a body plan that shows many unusual adaptations, mostly to facilitate flight. The skeleton consists of very lightweight bones. They have large air-filled cavities (called pneumatic cavities) which connect with the respiratory system. The skull bones in adults are fused and do not show cranial sutures. The orbits are large and separated by a bony septum. The spine has cervical, thoracic, lumbar and caudal regions with the number of cervical (neck) vertebrae highly variable and especially flexible, but movement is reduced in the anterior thoracic vertebrae and absent in the later vertebrae.\n[5] Title: \"Bird anatomy\" Text:  The middle avian ear is made up of three semicircular canals, each ending in an ampulla and joining to connect with the macula sacculus and lagena, of which the cochlea, a straight short tube to the external ear, branches from. Birds have a large brain to body mass ratio. This is reflected in the advanced and complex bird intelligence. The immune system of birds resembles that of other animals. Birds have both innate and adaptive immune systems. Birds are susceptible to tumours, immune deficiency and autoimmune diseases. The bursa of fabricius, also known as the cloacal bursa, is a lymphoid organ which aids in the production of B lymphocytes during humoral immunity.\nQuestion: what does a bird have that no other animal has\nYour answer: ",

The film initially received negative reviews in the United States but has been met with a more positive reception in subsequent years, with some critics viewing it as one of Lynch's major works.\n[2] Title: \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\" Text:  Fenn's character was cut from the script, Moira Kelly was cast as Donna, and Beymer's scenes were not filmed. In a September 2007 interview, Beymer claimed that he did not appear in any scenes shot for the film, although his character, Benjamin Horne, appeared in the script. MacLachlan's reluctance was also caused by a decline of quality in the second season of the show. He said \"\"David and Mark [Frost] were only around for the first season... I think we all felt a little abandoned.\n[3] Title: \"Twin Peaks\" Text:  It was published on October 18, 2016. The 1992 film \"\"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\"\" is a prequel to the TV series.

Director David Lynch and most of the television cast returned for the film, with the notable exceptions of Lara Flynn Boyle, who declined to return as Laura's best friend Donna Hayward and was replaced by Moira Kelly, and Sherilyn Fenn due to scheduling conflicts.\n[4] Title: \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\" Text:  The film was made without \"\"Twin Peaks\"\" series regulars Lara Flynn Boyle, Sherilyn Fenn, and Richard Beymer. At the time, these absences were attributed to scheduling conflicts, but in a 1995 interview, Fenn said that her real reason was that she \"\"was extremely disappointed in the way the second season got off track. As far as \"\"Fire Walk with Me\"\", it was something that I chose not to be a part of.\"\" In a 2014 interview, however, Fenn said that it was ultimately a scheduling conflict with \"\"Of Mice and Men\"\" that prevented her from committing to the film.\n[5] Title: \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\" Text:  At FBI headquarters in Philadelphia, Cole and Agent Dale Cooper experience a brief vision of their long-lost colleague Agent Phillip Jeffries.

His high energy level, showmanship and inventive secondary role play behind the often brilliant guitar work of Joe Kelley, intertwined with drummer Tom Shiffour's riffing, helped give the band its signature sound. McGeorge's insistence the band not stray from its unique sound resulted in the ground-breaking live studio recording techniques employed in production of the band's late 1966 classic \"\"I'm Gonna Make You Mine\"\".

Chicago, known for electric blues, continued to have a strong recording industry in the 1960s and was also a hotbed of activity for garage rock. Chicago blues as well as the Rolling Stones, the Pretty Things, and the Yardbirds influenced the Shadows of Knight, who recorded for Dunwich Records and were known for a tough, hard-driving sound.

Thus the Colony of Fiji was founded; 96 years of British rule followed. Fiji during the time of Cakobau The first three-quarters of the 19th century were marked by tribal warfare, incursions from neighbouring Tonga, and the increasing encroachment of foreign powers. This period also saw the rise of a warlord by the name of Seru Epenisa Cakobau, who forged the first nation-state covering all of modern Fiji (except the island of Rotuma) in 1871, before ceding it to the United Kingdom in 1874.\n[3] Title: \"Monarchy of Fiji\" Text:  In 1874, he was the lead signatory on the deed of cession which granted Britain sovereignty over the islands, and it was his efforts that brought Fiji under the guidance of the British Empire. After cession in 1874, all historical records refer to Seru Cakobau as only \"\"Vunivalu\"\" of Bau, or \"\"Ratu\"\" Seru Cakobau, indicating the title \"\"Tui Viti\"\" was lost when the sovereignty of Fiji was ceded to the British Crown. When \"\"Ratu\"\" Seru Cakobau signed the deed of cession he also presented his prized war club to Queen Victoria, the British monarch, as a symbol of his submission and loyalty.\n[4] Title: \"Colony of Fiji\" Text:  Mounting debts and threats from the United States Navy had led Cakobau to establish a constitutional monarchy with a government dominated by European settlers in 1871, following an agreement with the Australian Polynesia Company to pay his debts. The collapse of the new regime drove him to make another offer of cession in 1872, which the British accepted. On 10 October 1874, Britain began its rule of Fiji, which lasted until 10 October 1970. Sir Hercules Robinson, who had arrived on 23 September 1874, was appointed as interim Governor. He was replaced in June 1875 by Sir Arthur Gordon.\n[5] Title: \"Monarchy of Fiji\" Text:  It was the latter in tandem with his claims to the title and European claims for monetary compensation that would contribute to his reasons for ceding Fiji to Britain in 1874. Even though Seru Cakobau was not recognised by all Fijians as King of Fiji, his use of the title, and its recognition by many of the leading chiefs, led European settlers and foreign powers to treat him as a native king. Though Seru Cakobau was considered equal but not necessarily superior by his fellow chiefs, he was recognised as king by the Western powers.\nQuestion: why was the deed of cession important to fijis history\nYour answer: ",

In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina introduced Mosaic, the first web browser capable of displaying inline images and the basis for later browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer. The Internet expanded quickly, and by 1996, it was part of mass culture and many businesses listed websites in their ads. By 1999 almost every country had a connection, and nearly half of Americans and people in several other countries used the Internet on a regular basis.\n[2] Title: \"Internet service provider\" Text:  By the late 1980s, a process was set in place towards public, commercial use of the Internet. The remaining restrictions were removed by 1991, shortly after the introduction of the World Wide Web. During the 1980s, online service providers such as CompuServe and America On Line (AOL) began to offer limited capabilities to access the Internet, such as e-mail interchange, but full access to the internet was not readily available to the general public. In 1989, the first Internet service providers, companies offering the public direct access to the Internet for a monthly fee, were established in Australia and the United States.\n[3] Title: Internet Text:  Although other network protocols such as UUCP had global reach well before this time, this marked the beginning of the Internet as an intercontinental network. Public commercial use of the Internet began in mid-1989 with the connection of MCI Mail and Compuserve's email capabilities to the 500,000 users of the Internet. Just months later on 1 January 1990, PSInet launched an alternate Internet backbone for commercial use; one of the networks that would grow into the commercial Internet we know today. In March 1990, the first high-speed T1 (1.5 Mbit/s) link between the NSFNET and Europe was installed between Cornell University and CERN, allowing much more robust communications than were capable with satellites.\n[4] Title: \"History of the Internet\" Text:  Companies like PSINet, UUNET, Netcom, and Portal Software were formed to provide service to the regional research networks and provide alternate network access, UUCP-based email and Usenet News to the public. The first commercial dialup ISP in the United States was The World, which opened in 1989. In 1992, the U.S. Congress passed the Scientific and Advanced-Technology Act, , which allowed NSF to support access by the research and education communities to computer networks which were not used exclusively for research and education purposes, thus permitting NSFNET to interconnect with commercial networks.\n[5] Title: \"History of the Internet\" Text:  By the 1990s it provided a worldwide networking infrastructure. Unlike ARPANET, X.25 was commonly available for business use. Telenet offered its Telemail electronic mail service, which was also targeted to enterprise use rather than the general email system of the ARPANET. The first public dial-in networks used asynchronous TTY terminal protocols to reach a concentrator operated in the public network. Some networks, such as CompuServe, used X.25 to multiplex the terminal sessions into their packet-switched backbones, while others, such as Tymnet, used proprietary protocols. In 1979, CompuServe became the first service to offer electronic mail capabilities and technical support to personal computer users.\nQuestion: when did the internet first become available to the public\nYour answer: ",

Despite fourteen bullet wounds, he was still conscious, but died three hours later, refusing to utter a word about the identities of the killers. The Valentine's Day Massacre set off a public outcry that posed a problem for all mob bosses. Since it was common knowledge that Moran was hijacking Capone's Detroit-based liquor shipments, police focused their attention on Detroit's predominantly Jewish Purple Gang. Mug shots of Purple members George Lewis, Eddie Fletcher, Phil Keywell and his younger brother Harry, were picked out by landladies Mrs. Doody and Mrs. Orvidson, who had taken in three men as roomers ten days before the massacre; their rooming houses were directly across the street from the Clark Street garage.\n[5] Title: \"Saint Valentine's Day Massacre\" Text:  Though the perpetrators have not been conclusively identified, former members of the Egan's Rats gang, working for Capone, are suspected of a significant role as are members of the Chicago Police Department who are said to have had personal revenge as their motive following the killing of a police officer's son. At 10:30 a.m. on Thursday, February 14, 1929, seven men were murdered at the garage at 2122 North Clark Street, in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago's North Side.

Norway, Denmark and Sweden have higher VATs at 25%, Hungary has the highest at 27% although reduced rates are used in some cases, as for groceries, art, books and newspapers. In some jurisdictions of the United States, there are multiple levels of government which each impose a sales tax. For example, sales tax in Chicago (Cook County), IL is 10.25%, consisting of 6.25% state, 1.25% city, 1.75% county and 1% regional transportation authority.\n[4] Title: \"Tax rate\" Text:  The majority of Europe, value added tax (VAT) countries, include the tax amount when quoting merchandise prices, including Goods and Services Tax (GST) countries, such as Australia and New Zealand. However, those countries still define their tax rates on a tax exclusive basis. For direct rate comparisons between exclusive and inclusive taxes, one rate must be manipulated to look like the other. When a tax system imposes taxes primarily on income, the tax base is a household's pre-tax income. The appropriate income tax rate is applied to the tax base to calculate taxes owed.\n[5] Title: \"Budget of the European Union\" Text:  Further adjustments are made where there is a derogation from the VAT directive allowing certain goods to be zero-rated. The tax base is capped, such that it may not be greater than 50% of a country's gross national income (GNI). Member countries generally pay 0.3% of their harmonised tax base into the budget, but this is varied for some countries. The rate for Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden is 0.15% in the 2014-2020 period, while Austria also had a reduced rate in the 2007-2013 period.

Bhoot of Bombay, joined Jankidas to form the National Cyclists' Federation of India in 1946, and they registered this new body with the world governing association, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). The Cycling Federation of India then sent teams to the Olympic Games, the Asian Games, and major international cycling events \u2013 for example, the London Olympics in 1948; the Warsaw-Berlin-Prague Race (the Peace Race) in 1952, 1954, 1955 (where the organisers covered all expenses and so these peace races were cost-free to Indian authorities); and the Tokyo International Championships in 1961.\n[4] Title: \"Indian Olympic Association\" Text:  Subsequently, in 1923-24, a provisional All India Olympic Committee was formed, and the All India Olympic Games (that later became the National Games of India) were held in Feb 1924. Eight athletes from these games were selected to represent India at the 1924 Paris Olympics, accompanied by manager Harry Crowe Buck. This gave impetus to the development and institutionalization of sports in India, and, in 1927, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), was created at the initiative of Harry Crowe Buck and Dr. A. G. Noehren (both of the Madras (YMCA) College of Physical Education).\n[5] Title: \"India at the Olympics\" Text:  In 1923, a provisional All India Olympic Committee was formed, and in February 1924, the All India Olympic Games (that later became the National Games of India) were held to select a team for the Paris Summer Olympics.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" Text:  Epic of Gilgamesh The Epic of Gilgamesh () is an epic poem from ancient Mesopotamia that is often regarded as the earliest surviving great work of literature. The literary history of Gilgamesh begins with five Sumerian poems about Bilgamesh (Sumerian for \"\"Gilgamesh\"\"), king of Uruk, dating from the Third Dynasty of Ur (). These independent stories were later used as source material for a combined epic in Akkadian. The first surviving version of this combined epic, known as the \"\"Old Babylonian\"\" version, dates to the 18th century BC and is titled after its \"\"incipit\"\", Sh\u016btur eli sharr\u012b (\"\"Surpassing All Other Kings\"\").\n[2] Title: \"Epic poetry\" Text:  The oldest epic recognized is the \"\"Epic of Gilgamesh\"\" (), which was recorded In ancient Sumer during the Neo-Sumerian Empire. The poem details the exploits of Gilgamesh, the king of Uruk. Although recognized as a historical figure, Gilgamesh, as represented in the epic, is a largely legendary or mythical figure. The longest epic written is the ancient Indian \"\"Mahabharata\"\", which consists of 100,000 \u015blokas or over 200,000 verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), as well as long prose passages, so that at about 1.8 million words it is about four times the length of the \"\"R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a\"\", and roughly ten times the length of the \"\"Iliad\"\" and the \"\"Odyssey\"\" combined.\n[3] Title: \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" Text:  Distinct sources exist from over a 2000-year timeframe. The earliest Sumerian poems are now generally considered to be distinct stories, rather than parts of a single epic. They date from as early as the Third Dynasty of Ur (). The Old Babylonian tablets (), are the earliest surviving tablets for a single \"\"Epic of Gilgamesh\"\" narrative. The older Old Babylonian tablets and later Akkadian version are important sources for modern translations, with the earlier texts mainly used to fill in gaps (lacunae) in the later texts.\n[4] Title: \"Hormuzd Rassam\" Text:  Layard left archeology to begin a political career. Rassam continued field work (1852\u201354) at Nimrud and Nineveh, where he made a number of important and independent discoveries. These included the clay tablets that would later be deciphered by George Smith as the \"\"Epic of Gilgamesh\"\", the world's oldest written narrative poem. The tablets' description of a flood myth written 1000 years prior to the earliest record of the Biblical story of Noah, caused much debate at the time about the Biblical narrative of ancient history.\n[5] Title: Gilgamesh Text:  The Akkadian text of the \"\"Epic of Gilgamesh\"\" was first discovered in 1849 AD by the English archaeologist Austen Henry Layard in the Library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh. Layard was seeking evidence to confirm the historicity of the events described in the Christian Old Testament, which, at the time, was believed to contain the oldest texts in the world. Instead, his excavations and those of others after him revealed the existence of much older Mesopotamian texts and showed that many of the stories in the Old Testament may actually be derived from earlier myths told throughout the ancient Near East.\nQuestion: the world 's oldest epic tale told in poetry is called the epic of\nYour answer: ",

Encouraged by the results of this new method of advertising, General Mills changed its brand strategy. Instead of dropping the cereal, it purchased nationwide commercial time for the advertisement. The resultant climb in sales single-handedly established the \"\"Wheaties\"\" brand nationwide. After General Mills' success, other companies began to investigate this new method of advertisement.\n[5] Title: \"Eric Idle\" Text:  In 1990, Idle sang and co-wrote the theme tune to the popular British sitcom \"\"One Foot in the Grave\"\".

With help from Radio 1 breakfast show host Simon Mayo, who gave the song regular airplay and also used the chorus within a jingle, it became a hit, some 12 years after the song's original appearance in \"\"Life of Brian\"\", reaching number 3 in the UK charts and landing Idle a set on \"\"Top of the Pops\"\" in October 1991.\nQuestion: who wrote the jingle nationwide is on your side\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Coptic language\" Text:  Coptic language Coptic, or Coptic Egyptian (Bohairic: \"\"ti.met.rem.\u0259n.k\u0113mi\"\" and Sahidic: \"\"t.m\u0259nt.r\u0259m.\u0259n.k\u0113me\"\"), is the latest stage of the Egyptian language, a northern Afro-Asiatic language spoken in Egypt until at least the 17th century as an official language. Egyptian began to be written in the Coptic alphabet, an adaptation of the Greek alphabet with the addition of six or seven signs from Demotic to represent Egyptian sounds the Greek language did not have, in the 1st century AD. Several distinct Coptic dialects are identified, the most prominent of which are \"\"Sahidic\"\", originating in parts of Upper Egypt, and \"\"Bohairic\"\", originally from the western Nile Delta in Lower Egypt.\n[2] Title: \"Coptic language\" Text:  Scholars frequently refer to this phase as pre-Coptic. However, it is clear that by the Late Period of ancient Egypt, demotic scribes regularly employed a more phonetic orthography, a testament to the increasing cultural contact between Egyptians and Greeks even before Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt. Coptic itself, or Old Coptic, takes root in the first century. The transition from the older Egyptian scripts to the newly adapted Coptic alphabet was in part due to the decline of the traditional role played by the priestly class of ancient Egyptian religion, who unlike most ordinary Egyptians, were literate in the temple scriptoria.\n[3] Title: \"Coptic language\" Text:  Coptic belongs to the Later Egyptian phase, which started to be written in the New Kingdom of Egypt. Later Egyptian represented colloquial speech of the later periods. It had analytic features like definite and indefinite articles and periphrastic verb conjugation. Coptic, therefore, is a reference to both the most recent stage of Egyptian after Demotic and the new writing system that was adapted from the Greek alphabet. The earliest attempts to write the Egyptian language using the Greek alphabet are Greek transcriptions of Egyptian proper names, most of which date to the Ptolemaic Kingdom.\n[4] Title: \"Coptic language\" Text:  Coptic and Demotic are grammatically closely related to Late Egyptian, which was written with Egyptian hieroglyphs. Coptic flourished as a literary language from the 2nd to 13th centuries, and its Bohairic dialect continues to be the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. It was supplanted by Egyptian Arabic as a spoken language toward the early modern period, but language revitalization efforts have been underway since the 19th century. The native Coptic name for the language is in the Bohairic (Delta) dialect, in the Sahidic (Valley) dialect.\n[5] Title: \"Coptic language\" Text:  The core lexicon of Coptic is Egyptian, most closely related to the preceding Demotic phase of the language. Up to 40% of the vocabulary of literary Coptic is drawn from Greek, but borrowings are not always fully adapted to the Coptic phonological system and may have semantic differences as well. There are instances of Coptic texts having passages that are almost entirely composed from Greek lexical roots. However, that is likely due to the fact that the majority of Coptic religious texts are direct translations of Greek works. \u2018What invariably attracts the attention of the reader of a Coptic text, especially if it is written in the Sa'idic dialect, is the very liberal use which is made of Greek loan words, of which so few, indeed, are to be found in the Ancient Egyptian language.\nQuestion: what is the origin of the coptic language\nYour answer: ",

Following the Ostpolitik the West German view was that East Germany was a \"\"de facto\"\" government within a single German nation and a \"\"de jure\"\" state organisation of parts of Germany outside the Federal Republic.\n[3] Title: \"History of Germany\" Text:  In September 1973, both West and East Germany were admitted to the United Nations. The two countries exchanged permanent representatives in 1974, and, in 1987, East Germany's leader Erich Honecker paid an official state visit to West Germany. After 1973, Germany was hard hit by a worldwide economic crisis, soaring oil prices, and stubbornly high unemployment, which jumped from 300,000 in 1973 to 1.1 million in 1975. The Ruhr region was hardest hit, as its easy-to-reach coal mines petered out, and expensive German coal was no longer competitive.\n[4] Title: \"Council of Foreign Ministers\" Text:  Under the agreement and the treaty, both German states joined the United Nations (September 1973). After the fall of the Berlin Wall, on 12 September 1990 the Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany was signed by the four powers and the two German governments, which was the final peace treaty of World War II and the restoration of German sovereignty. This allowed German reunification to take place on 3 October 1990 and the reunited country became fully sovereign again on 15 March 1991. Council of Foreign Ministers Council of Foreign Ministers was an organisation agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference in 1945 and announced in the Potsdam Agreement.\n[5] Title: \"History of Germany (1945\u201390)\" Text:  Relations gradually improved. In the early 1970s, the \"\"Ostpolitik\"\" led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany. The Treaty of Moscow (August 1970), the Treaty of Warsaw (December 1970), the Four Power Agreement on Berlin (September 1971), the Transit Agreement (May 1972), and the Basic Treaty (December 1972) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both states joining the United Nations, in September 1973. The two German states exchanged permanent representatives in 1974, and, in 1987, East German head of state Erich Honecker paid an official visit to West Germany.\nQuestion: when did germany become part of the un\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Political parties in the United States\" Text:  Political scientists and historians have divided the development of America's two-party system into five eras. The first two-party system consisted of the Federalist Party, who supported the ratification of the Constitution, and the Democratic-Republican Party or the Anti-Administration party (Anti-Federalists), who opposed the powerful central government, among others, that the Constitution established when it took effect in 1789. The modern two-party system consists of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Several third parties also operate in the U.S., and from time to time elect someone to local office.\n[2] Title: \"Two-party system\" Text:  Out of this chaos, the first distinctive parties emerged. The first such party was the Rockingham Whigs under the leadership of Charles Watson-Wentworth and the intellectual guidance of the political philosopher Edmund Burke. Burke laid out a philosophy that described the basic framework of the political party as \"\"a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavours the national interest, upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed\"\". As opposed to the instability of the earlier factions, which were often tied to a particular leader and could disintegrate if removed from power, the two party system was centred on a set of core principles held by both sides and that allowed the party out of power to remain as the Loyal Opposition to the governing party.\n[3] Title: \"Political parties in the United States\" Text:  Nevertheless, the beginnings of the American two-party system emerged from his immediate circle of advisers. Hamilton and Madison, who wrote the aforementioned Federalist Papers against political factions, ended up being the core leaders in this emerging party system. It was the split camps of Federalists, given rise with Hamilton as a leader, and Democratic-Republicans, with Madison and Thomas Jefferson at the helm of this political faction, that created the environment in which partisanship, once distasteful, came to being. The First Party System of the United States featured the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party (also called \"\"Democratic-Republican\"\" or \"\"Jeffersonian Republican\"\").\n[4] Title: \"First Party System\" Text:  First Party System The First Party System is a model of American politics used in history and political science to periodize the political party system that existed in the United States between roughly 1792 and 1824. It featured two national parties competing for control of the presidency, Congress, and the states: the Federalist Party, created largely by Alexander Hamilton, and the rival Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican Party, formed by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, usually called at the time the Republican Party. The Federalists were dominant until 1800, while the Republicans were dominant after 1800.\n[5] Title: \"Two-party system\" Text:  There is general agreement that the United States has a two-party system; historically, there have been few instances in which third party candidates won an election. In the First Party System, only Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Party and Thomas Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party were significant political parties. Toward the end of the First Party System, the Republicans dominated a one-party system (primarily under the Presidency of James Monroe). Under the Second Party System, the Democratic-Republican Party split during the election of 1824 into Adams' Men and Jackson's Men.\nQuestion: the initial parties of the two party system were\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Baseball bat\" Text:  Today, bats are much more uniform in design. Baseball bats are made of either wood, or a metal alloy (typically aluminum). Most wooden bats are made from ash; other woods include maple, hickory, and bamboo. Hickory has fallen into disfavor over its greater weight, which slows down bat speed, while maple bats gained popularity following the introduction of the first major league sanctioned model in 1997. The first player to use one was Joe Carter of the Toronto Blue Jays. Barry Bonds used maple bats the seasons he broke baseball's single-season home run record in 2001, and the career home run record in 2007.\n[2] Title: Wood Text:  The baseball bats which are legal for use in Major League Baseball are frequently made of ash wood or hickory, and in recent years have been constructed from maple even though that wood is somewhat more fragile. NBA courts have been traditionally made out of parquetry. Many other types of sports and recreation equipment, such as skis, ice hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks and archery bows, were commonly made of wood in the past, but have since been replaced with more modern materials such as aluminium, titanium or composite materials such as fiberglass and carbon fiber.\n[3] Title: \"Batting (baseball)\" Text:  White ash is used because of its hardness, durability, strength, weight and feel. Trees that provide the lumber for baseball bats are often 50 years old, and of all the lumber harvested, the top 10 percent is saved for pro bats. Recent technology in drying wood has created bats with lower moisture content, which are light enough to make effective baseball bats. Rock or Sugar Maple bats are preferred. Maple bats cost more than white ash, but they often last longer as a result of their high strength.\n[4] Title: \"Batting (baseball)\" Text:  The player in the batting order after the on deck batter is said to be \"\"in the hole\"\". When baseball was in its beginning years, baseball players made their own bats. This allowed players to experiment with different shapes and sizes of the bats. It did not take long for players to realize that the best bats were those with rounded barrels. Wood bats are rare at most levels other than the pros. The majority of wood baseball bats today are made from northern white ash harvested from Pennsylvania or New York.\n[5] Title: Hickory Text:  Paddles are often made from hickory. This property of hickory wood has left a trace in some Native American languages: in Ojibwe, hickory is called \"\"mitigwaabaak\"\", a compound of \"\"mitigwaab\"\" \"\"bow\"\" and the final \"\"-aakw\"\" \"\"hardwood tree\"\". Baseball bats were formerly made of hickory, but are now more commonly made of ash. Hickory is replacing ash as the wood of choice for Scottish shinty sticks (also known as camans). Hickory was extensively used for the construction of early aircraft.\nQuestion: what type of wood are baseball bats made from\nYour answer: ",

A popular regional fast food, it has its roots in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The cheesesteak was developed in the early 20th century \"\"by combining frizzled beef, onions, and cheese in a small loaf of bread\"\", according to a 1987 exhibition catalog published by the Library Company of Philadelphia and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.\n[2] Title: Cheesesteak Text:  After commenting on the debates over types of cheese and \"\"chopped steak or sliced,\"\" \"\"Risk and Insurance\"\" magazine declared \"\"The only thing nearly everybody can agree on is that it all has to be piled onto a fresh, locally baked Amoroso roll.\"\" American cheese, Cheez Whiz, and provolone are the most commonly used cheeses or cheese products put on to the Philly cheesesteak. White American cheese, along with provolone cheese, are the favorites due to their mild flavor and medium consistency.\n[3] Title: \"Amoroso's Baking Company\" Text:  Amoroso's Baking Company Amoroso's Baking Company is a family-owned company that specializes in hearth baked breads and rolls. Over the years the Amoroso sandwich roll has become synonymous with those Philadelphia culinary institutions, the hoagie and the cheesesteak. The company was founded in 1904 in Camden, New Jersey by Vincenzo Amoroso and his sons, Salvatore and Joseph. Having outgrown their location in Camden, the company moved to a new facility at 6505 Haverford Avenue in Philadelphia in 1914. The company thrived during the Great Depression by making home deliveries twice a day, in the mornings and afternoons.\n[4] Title: \"Cuisine of Philadelphia\" Text:  Today, cheese choices in Philadelphia eateries are virtually limited to American, Provolone, or Cheez Whiz. The latter is especially popular in those places that prominently carry it. The hoagie is another sandwich that is said to have been invented in Philadelphia, undoubtedly of origin in Italian-American cuisine. It has been asserted that Italians working at the World War I era shipyard in Philadelphia, known as Hog Island where emergency shipping was produced for the war effort, introduced the sandwich, by putting various sliced meats, cheeses, and lettuce between two slices of Italian bread.\n[5] Title: \"Cuisine of Philadelphia\" Text:  In the 1930s, the phenomenon as a steak sandwich began when hot dog vendor brothers Pat Olivieri and Harry Olivieri put grilled beef on a hot dog bun and gave it to a taxi driver. Later, after Pat and Harry had started selling the sandwich on Italian rolls, the cheesesteak was affixed in the local culture when one of their cooks put melted cheese on the sandwich. Originally, the cheese was melted in a separate container to accommodate their large clientele who followed kosher rules (thereby not mixing dairy and meat).\nQuestion: what type of bread for philly cheese steak\nYour answer: ",

The treaty came into force in Cuba April 11, 1899, with Cubans participating only as observers. Having been occupied since July 17, 1898, and thus under the jurisdiction of the United States Military Government (USMG), Cuba formed its own civil government and gained independence on May 20, 1902, with the announced end of USMG jurisdiction over the island. However, the U.S. imposed various restrictions on the new government, including prohibiting alliances with other countries, and reserved the right to intervene.\n[2] Title: \"Territorial evolution of the United States\" Text:  Desires for expansion into Spanish territories like Cuba led to the Spanish\u2013American War in 1898, in which the United States gained Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, and occupied Cuba for several years. American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War. The United States purchased the U.S. Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917. Guam and Puerto Rico remain territories; the Philippines became independent in 1946, after being a major theater of World War II. Following the war, many islands were entrusted to the U.S. by the United Nations, and while the Northern Mariana Islands remain a U.S. territory, the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau emerged from the trust territory as independent nations.\n[3] Title: \"Political divisions of the United States\" Text:  Thirty-one of the current 50 states were organized incorporated territories, or part of one, before their admission to the Union. No incorporated organized territories have existed since 1959 when Alaska and Hawaii joined the Union. Currently, 5 territories are self-governing. The current inhabited unincorporated territories of the United States and their ISO 3166-1 codes (in parentheses) are as follows: Guam and Puerto Rico, both gained by the United States in the Spanish\u2013American War, are considered part of the \"\"United States\"\" for purposes of law; on the other hand, the United States Supreme Court declared in a series of opinions known as the Insular Cases that the Constitution extended \"\"ex proprio vigore\"\" to the territories.\n[4] Title: \"Insular Cases\" Text:  The Insular Cases \u201cauthorized the colonial regime created by Congress, which allowed the United States to continue its administration\u2014and exploitation\u2014 of the territories acquired from Spain after the Spanish\u2013American War.\"\" These Supreme Court rulings allowed for the United States government to extend unilateral power over these newly acquired territories. The Court also established the doctrine of territorial incorporation, under which the Constitution applied fully only in incorporated territories such as Alaska and Hawaii. Incorporated territories are those that the government deems on a path to statehood. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court ruled the Constitution applied only partially in the newly unincorporated Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines.\n[5] Title: \"Rough Riders\" Text:  The armistice also gained the United States the territories of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. This large acquisition of land elevated the United States to the level of an imperial power. The Spanish\u2013American War also began a trend of United States intervention in foreign affairs which has lasted to the present day. On August 14, the Rough Riders landed at Montauk Point on Long Island, New York. There, they met up with the other four companies that had been left behind in Tampa. Colonel Roosevelt made note of how very many of the men who were left behind felt guilty for not serving in Cuba with the others.\nQuestion: which territories did the us gain in the spanish-american war\nYour answer: ",

The first Miss India was Pramila (Esther Victoria Abraham), from Calcutta, who won in 1947.\n[2] Title: \"Femina Miss India\" Text:  In 1994, after India's historic win at the International pageants, the organisation ended the practice of crowning a single winner and instead decided that the top three winners were designated as winners with equal visibility and prizes. In 2002, the third winner was designated to Miss Earth instead of Miss Asia Pacific. In 2010, after the I Am She - Miss Universe India acquired the rights to send India's representatives to Miss Universe, Femina Miss India crowned three winners as \"\"Femina Miss India World\"\", \"\"Femina Miss India Earth\"\" and \"\"Femina Miss India International\"\", the third winner representend India in Miss International pageant.\n[3] Title: \"Femina Miss India\" Text:  The success of Rai and Sen spawned coaching institutions which were set up to groom young women in pageant participation skills.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)\" Text:  The United States acquired the islands of Puerto Rico in 1898 after the Spanish\u2013American War. In 1950, Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 81-600) authorizing Puerto Rico to hold a constitutional convention and in 1952, the people of Puerto Rico ratified a constitution establishing a republican form of government for the island. Puerto Rico's political relationship with the U.S. has been a continuing source of debate in Puerto Rico, the United States Congress, and the United Nations. The issue revolves around whether Puerto Rico should remain a U.S. territory, become a U.S. state, or become an independent country.\n[2] Title: \"Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)\" Text:  The Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico says that in 1952 there was a pact between Puerto Rico and the United States that gave Puerto Rico an autonomous government and removed it from the list of colonies. The territory was organized by the Foraker Act in 1900, which was amended by the Jones\u2013Shafroth Act in 1917. The drafting of the Constitution of Puerto Rico by its residents was authorized by Congress in 1951, and the result approved in 1952. The government of Puerto Rico has held several referenda with the options of U.S. statehood, independence, and commonwealth; the commonwealth option won on multiple plebiscite's held in 1967, 1993, and 1998.\n[3] Title: \"Puerto Rican Campaign\" Text:  In 1947, the U.S. granted Puerto Ricans the right to democratically elect their own governor, which it first exercised in 1948. The Constitution of Puerto Rico was approved by a Constitutional Convention on February 6, 1952, ratified by the U.S. Congress, and approved by President Truman on July 3 of that year. Puerto Rico adopted the name of \"\"Estado Libre Asociado\"\" (literally translated as \"\"Free Associated State\"\"), officially translated into English as Commonwealth, for its body politic. In Puerto Rico there are no monuments to commemorate the Spanish\u2013American War as such.\n[4] Title: \"Constitutional Convention of Puerto Rico\" Text:  Constitutional Convention of Puerto Rico On June 8, 1950, the United States government approved Public Law 600, authorizing Puerto Rico to draft its own constitution in 1951. The Constitutional Assembly met for a period of several months between 1951 and 1952 in which the document was written. The framers had to follow only two basic requirements established under Public Law 600. The first was the document must establish a republican form of government for the island. The second was the inclusion of a Bill of Rights. The Constitution of Puerto Rico renamed the body politic until then known as \"\"People of Puerto Rico\"\", and henceforth known as the \"\"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\"\" (Estado Libre Asociado).\n[5] Title: \"Puerto Rico\" Text:  Puerto Rico's electorate expressed its support for this measure in 1951 with a second referendum to ratify the constitution. The Constitution of Puerto Rico was formally adopted on July 3, 1952. The Constitutional Convention specified the name by which the body politic would be known. On February 4, 1952, the convention approved Resolution 22 which chose in English the word \"\"Commonwealth\"\", meaning a \"\"politically organized community\"\" or \"\"state\"\", which is simultaneously connected by a compact or treaty to another political system.\nQuestion: when did puerto rico become a commonwealth of the united states\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Moon Text:  Such cultural influences can be found in language, lunar calendar systems, art, and mythology. The usual English proper name for Earth's natural satellite is \"\"the Moon\"\", which in nonscientific texts is usually not capitalized. The noun \"\"moon\"\" is derived from Old English \"\"m\u014dna\"\", which (like all Germanic language cognates) stems from Proto-Germanic \"\"*m\u0113n\u00f4\"\", which comes from Proto-Indo-European \"\"*m\u1e17h\u2081n\u0325s\"\" \"\"moon\"\", \"\"month\"\", which comes from the Proto-Indo-European root \"\"*meh\u2081-\"\" \"\"to measure\"\", the month being the ancient unit of time measured by the Moon.\n[2] Title: \"Naming of moons\" Text:  In the 17th century, the Moon was sometimes referred to as \"\"Proserpina\"\". More recently, especially in science-fictional contexts, the Moon has been called by the Latin name \"\"Luna\"\", presumably on the analogy of the Latin names of the planets, or by association with the adjectival form \"\"lunar\"\". In technical terminology, the word-stems \"\"seleno-\"\" (from Greek \"\"sel\u0113n\u0113\"\" \"\"moon\"\") and \"\"cynthi-\"\" (from \"\"Cynthia\"\", an epithet of the goddess Artemis) are sometimes used to refer to the Moon, as in \"\"selenography, selenology,\"\" and \"\"pericynthion.\"\"\n[3] Title: \"Astronomical naming conventions\" Text:  The first exoplanet tentatively identified around the second brightest star in the triple star system Alpha Centauri is accordingly called Alpha Centauri Bb. If an exoplanet orbits both of the stars in a binary system, its name can be, for example, Kepler-34(AB) b. Earth's natural satellite is simply known as the Moon, or the equivalent in the language being spoken (for instance, two astronomers speaking French would call it \"\"la Lune\"\"). It is sometimes called \"\"Luna\"\" (which is simply Latin for \"\"moon\"\"), in science fiction.\n[4] Title: \"Naming of moons\" Text:  Until 2013, names were applied to all moons discovered, regardless of size. Since then, with the exceptions of Jupiter LIII Dia and Jupiter LXII Valetudo, no planetary satellite that was numbered received a name. Every human language has its own word for the Earth's Moon, and these words are the ones normally used in astronomical contexts. However, a number of fanciful or mythological names for the Moon have been used in the context of astronomy (an even larger number of lunar epithets have been used in non-astronomical contexts).\n[5] Title: \"Naming of moons\" Text:  The convention has been extended to natural satellites of minor planets, such as (87) Sylvia I Romulus. Roman numerals are usually not assigned to satellites until they are named, so many satellites that have been discovered but only have provisional designations do not usually have Roman numerals assigned to them. (An exception is Saturn's moon Helene, which received the Roman numeral XII in 1982, but was not named until 1988.) While the International Astronomical Union was assigning names to all satellites from 1975 to 2013, the use of Roman numeral designations diminished, and some are very rarely used; Phobos and Deimos are rarely referred to as Mars I and Mars II, and the Moon is never referred to as \"\"Earth I\"\".\nQuestion: what is the name for earth 's moon\nYour answer: ",

This bacterium is transmitted from bird to bird by ticks from the \"\"Argas\"\" and \"\"Ornitodorus\"\" genera.\n[2] Title: \"Proteus mirabilis\" Text:  It is commonly found in the human digestive system. \"\"P. mirabilis\"\" is not pathogenic in guinea pigs or chickens. Noteworthy is the ability of this species to inhibit growth of unrelated strains, resulting in a macroscopically visible line of reduced bacterial growth where two swarming strains intersect. This line is named the Dienes line after its discoverer Louis Dienes. The micro-organism tests: Proteus mirabilis Proteus mirabilis is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium. It shows swarming motility and urease activity. \"\"P. mirabilis\"\" causes 90% of all \"\"Proteus\"\" infections in humans.\n[3] Title: \"Chicken or the egg\" Text:  Whatever criteria one chooses, an animal nearly identical to the modern chicken (i.e., a proto-chicken) laid a fertilized egg that had DNA identical to the modern chicken (due to mutations in the mother's ovum, the father's sperm, or the fertilised zygote). Put more simply by Neil deGrasse Tyson: \"\"Which came first: the chicken or the egg? The egg\u2014laid by a bird that was not a chicken.\"\" It has been suggested that the actions of a protein found in modern chicken eggs may make the answer different.\n[4] Title: \"Chicken or the egg\" Text:  If the question refers to eggs in general, the egg came first. The first amniote egg\u2014that is, a hard-shelled egg that could be laid on land, rather than remaining in water like the eggs of fish or amphibians\u2014appeared around 312 million years ago. In contrast, chickens are domesticated descendants of red junglefowl and probably arose little more than eight thousand years ago, at most. If the question refers to \"\"chicken\"\" eggs specifically, the answer is still the egg, but the explanation is more complicated. The process by which the chicken arose through the interbreeding and domestication of multiple species of wild jungle fowl is poorly understood, and the point at which this evolving organism became a chicken is a somewhat arbitrary distinction.\n[5] Title: \"Chicken or the egg\" Text:  Chickens produce a protein, ovocleidin-17 (OC-17), that is expressed in the uterus and causes the formation of the thickened calcium carbonate shell around modern chicken eggs. Because OC-17 is expressed by the hen and not the egg, the bird in which the protein first arose, though having hatched from a non-reinforced egg, would then have laid the first egg having such a reinforced shell: the chicken would have preceded this first \"\"modern\"\" chicken egg. However, the presence of OC-17 or a homolog in other species, such as turkeys, and finches suggests that such eggshell-reinforcing proteins are common to all birds, and thus long predate the first chicken.\nQuestion: this organism is found inside the egg of a chicken\nYour answer: ",

In the original \"\"Halloween\"\", the adult Michael Myers, referred to as The Shape in the closing credits, was portrayed by Nick Castle for most of the film, with Tony Moran and Tommy Lee Wallace substituting in the final scenes.\n[2] Title: \"Halloween II (1981 film)\" Text:  Stunt performer Dick Warlock played Michael Myers (as in \"\"Halloween\"\", listed as \"\"The Shape\"\" in the credits), replacing Castle who was beginning a career as a director. Warlock's previous experience in film was as a stunt double in films, such as \"\"The Green Berets\"\" (1968) and \"\"Jaws\"\" (1975), and the 1974 television series \"\"\"\". In an interview, Warlock explained how he prepared for the role since Myers received far more screen time in the sequel than the original.\n[3] Title: \"Michael Myers (Halloween)\" Text:  The character was created by Debra Hill and John Carpenter and has appeared in ten films, as well as novels, multiple video games, and several comic books. The character is the primary antagonist in the \"\"Halloween\"\" film series, except \"\"\"\", which is not connected in continuity to the rest of the films. Since Castle, Moran, and Wallace put on the mask in the original film, six people have stepped into the same role. Castle, George P.

Denise Richards also auditioned for the part of Beth, but the studio passed on her, giving the role to Mariah O'Brien. Stunt performer George P.

The film mainly takes place in rural Berkeley County, South Carolina, and depicts the story of an American Colonist, nominally loyal to the British Crown, who is swept into the American Revolutionary War when his family is threatened. Benjamin Martin is a composite figure the scriptwriter claims is based on four factual figures from the American Revolutionary War: Andrew Pickens, Francis Marion, Daniel Morgan, and Thomas Sumter.\n[2] Title: \"The Patriot (2000 film)\" Text:  The film takes place during the events of the Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War but attracted controversy over its fictional portrayal of historical British figures and atrocities. Professor Mark Glancy, teacher of film history at Queen Mary, University of London has said: \"\"It's horrendously inaccurate and attributes crimes committed by the Nazis in the 1940s to the British in the 1770s.\"\" While it is clear that the actions of then-Colonel Banastre Tarleton were certainly despicable, they were nowhere near the atrocities in the film, especially with the infamous \"\"Burning church\"\" scene, of which there is no historical or written record.\n[3] Title: \"The Patriot (2000 film)\" Text:  Australian film critic David Edwards asserts that \"\"this fictional story is set around actual events, but it is not a history of what America was, or even an image of what it has become\u2014it's a dream of what it should be...\"\"The Patriot\"\" is a grand epic full of action and emotion...But it's also surprisingly insightful in its evaluation of the American ideal\u2014if not the reality.\"\" While, as critic Roger Ebert states, \"\"None of it has much to do with the historical reality of the Revolutionary War\"\".\n[4] Title: \"The Patriot (2000 film)\" Text:  Rodat said of Gibson's character: \"\"Benjamin Martin is a composite character made up of Thomas Sumter, Daniel Morgan, Andrew Pickens, and Francis Marion, and a few bits and pieces from a number of other characters.\"\" Rodat also indicated that the fictional Colonel William Tavington is \"\"loosely based on Colonel Banastre Tarleton, who was particularly known for his brutal acts\"\". While some events, such as Tarleton's pursuit of Francis Marion and his fellow irregular soldiers who escaped by disappearing into the swamps of South Carolina, were loosely based on history, and others were adapted, such as the final battle in the film which combined elements of the Battles of Cowpens and Battle of Guilford Court House, most of the plot events in the film are pure fiction.\n[5] Title: \"The Patriot (2000 film)\" Text:  Screenwriters consulting American works to build the character Tavington based on Tarleton would have commonly found descriptions of him as barbaric and accounts of his name being used for recruiting and motivation during the Revolutionary War itself. Whereas Tavington is depicted as aristocratic but penniless, Tarleton came from a wealthy Liverpool merchant family. Tarleton did not die in battle or from impalement, as Tavington did in the film. Tarleton died on January 16, 1833, in Leintwardine, Herefordshire, England, at the age of 78, nearly 50 years after the war ended.\nQuestion: what war was the movie the patriot based on\nYour answer: ",

On December 8, 1941, he commanded the North Luzon Force, comprising three reserve Filipino divisions and the 26th Cavalry Regiment (Philippine Scouts). Retreating from the Japanese beachhead of Lingayen Gulf, Allied forces had withdrawn onto the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor by January 1942, where they defended the entrance to Manila Bay.\n[2] Title: \"Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)\" Text:  MacArthur organized USAFFE into four tactical commands. The \"\"North Luzon Force\"\", activated 3 December 1941 under Maj. Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright, defended the most likely sites for amphibious attacks and the central plains of Luzon. Wainwright's forces included the PA 11th, 21st and 31st Infantry Divisions, the U.S. 26th Cavalry Regiment (PS), a battalion of the 45th Infantry (PS), and the 1st Provisional Artillery Group of two batteries of 155 mm guns and one 2.95 inch (75 mm) mountain gun.\n[3] Title: \"Douglas MacArthur\" Text:  On 26 July 1941, Roosevelt federalized the Philippine Army, recalled MacArthur to active duty in the U.S. Army as a major general, and named him commander of U.S. Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). MacArthur was promoted to lieutenant general the following day, and then to general on 20 December. On 31 July 1941, the Philippine Department had 22,000 troops assigned, 12,000 of whom were Philippine Scouts. The main component was the Philippine Division, under the command of Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright. The initial American plan for the defense of the Philippines called for the main body of the troops to retreat to the Bataan peninsula in Manila Bay to hold out against the Japanese until a relief force could arrive.\n[4] Title: \"Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)\" Text:  From mid-1941, following increased tension between Japan and several other powers, including the United States, Britain and the Netherlands, many countries in South East Asia and the Pacific began to prepare for the possibility of war. By December 1941, the combined defense forces in the Philippines were organized into the US Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), which eventually included the Philippine Army's 1st Regular Division, 2nd (Constabulary) Division, and 10 mobilized reserve divisions, and the United States Army's Philippine Department. General Douglas MacArthur was recalled from retirement by the U.S. War Department and named commander of USAFFE on 26 July 1941.\n[5] Title: \"Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)\" Text:  Its primary combat power in December 1941 consisted of 91 serviceable P-40 Warhawk fighters and 34 B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, with further modern aircraft en route. Tactically the FEAF was part of the Reserve Force, so that it fell under MacArthur's direct command. As of 30 November 1941, the strength of US Army Troops in the Philippines, including Philippine units, was 31,095, consisting of 2,504 officers and 28,591 enlisted (16,643 Americans and 11,957 Philippine Scouts). MacArthur's mobilization plans called for induction of the ten reserve divisions between 1 September and 15 December 1941.\nQuestion: in december of 1941 who commanded the allied forces in the philippines\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"United States Constitution\" Text:  The First Amendment (1791) prohibits Congress from obstructing the exercise of certain individual freedoms: freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, and right to petition. Its Free Exercise Clause guarantees a person's right to hold whatever religious beliefs he or she wants, and to freely exercise that belief, and its Establishment Clause prevents the federal government from creating an official national church or favoring one set of religious beliefs over another. The amendment guarantees an individual's right to express and to be exposed to a wide range of opinions and views.\n[2] Title: \"First Amendment to the United States Constitution\" Text:  First Amendment to the United States Constitution The First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution prevents the government from making laws which respect an establishment of religion, prohibit the free exercise of religion, or abridge the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the right to peaceably assemble, or the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. It was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights was originally proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification.\n[3] Title: \"Constitutional right\" Text:  For example, the First Amendment guarantees the freedom of religion, speech, and the press along with the rights of assembly and petition, the Second Amendment the right to bear arms and so on. However, in order to be easier to distinguish, the legal professionals have divided the constitutional rights into two categories: process rights and substantive rights. Whereas, the process rights refer to the powers and obligations of the government with respect to individuals, the substantive rights, more diverse than the process ones, incorporate the individual freedoms granted and protected by the national government.\n[4] Title: \"Freedom of speech in the United States\" Text:  Freedom of speech in the United States In the United States, freedom of speech and expression is strongly protected from government restrictions by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, many state constitutions, and state and federal laws. The Supreme Court of the United States has recognized several categories of speech that are given lesser or no protection by the First Amendment and has recognized that governments may enact reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions on speech. The First Amendment's constitutional right of free speech, which is applicable to state and local governments under the incorporation doctrine, only prevents government restrictions on speech, not restrictions imposed by private individuals or businesses unless they are acting on behalf of the government.\n[5] Title: \"Freedom of the press in the United States\" Text:  The First Amendment permits information, ideas and opinions without interference, constraint or prosecution by the government. It was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights. The 1931 U.S. Supreme Court decision \"\"Near v. Minnesota\"\" recognized freedom of the press by roundly rejecting prior restraints on publication, a principle that applied to free speech generally in subsequent jurisprudence. The court ruled that a Minnesota law targeting publishers of malicious or scandalous newspapers violated the First Amendment (as applied through the Fourteenth Amendment).\nQuestion: what are the five rights protected by the first amendment\nYour answer: ",

Campbell's first solo hit was \"\"Round and Round\"\", which charted at number 3 on the R&B chart in November 1990 and 12 on the \"\"Billboard\"\" Hot 100 in April 1991 was produced by Prince and was featured in Prince's film \"\"Graffiti Bridge\"\".\n[2] Title: T.E.V.I.N. Text:  T.E.V.I.N. T.E.V.I.N. is the debut album by R&B singer Tevin Campbell, released on November 19, 1991. The album was certified Platinum in 1994. \"\"T.E.V.I.N.\"\" yielded two No. 1 R&B hits in \"\"Tell Me What You Want Me to Do\"\" and \"\"Alone with You\"\", and had several other hits. Of the combined eight singles that were released off his debut album, five having peaked inside the R&B top 10, Prince produced \"\"Round and Round\"\", while Al B.\n[3] Title: T.E.V.I.N. Text:  Sure! and Kyle West produced \"\"Goodbye\"\" and \"\"Just Ask Me To\"\". The remaining singles off his album are \"\"Strawberry Letter 23\"\", \"\"One Song\"\" and \"\"Confused\"\". The success of the album also garnered Campbell his first two Grammy nominations, one in 1991 for Best Rhythm & Blues Vocal Performance - Male (for \"\"Round and Round\"\"), and one in 1992 for the same award Best Rhythm & Blues Vocal Performance - Male (for \"\"Tell Me What You Want Me to Do\"\").\n[4] Title: \"Tevin Campbell\" Text:  After his appearance in the 1990 film \"\"Graffiti Bridge\"\", Campbell made a guest appearance the following year on \"\"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\"\", playing fictional teen idol, \"\"Little T\"\", a celebrity crush and date of Ashley's in the first season episode, \"\"Just Infatuation\"\". In a later episode, he was referenced when Will threatened to destroy Ashley's Little T posters after she plays with Will's autographed baseball. The song, \"\"Round and Round\"\" earned Campbell a Grammy Award nomination at the 33rd Grammy Awards for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance but lost to Luther Vandross for \"\"Here and Now\"\".\n[5] Title: \"Mont Campbell\" Text:  Campbell released his first solo album, \"\"Music from a Round Tower\"\" in 1996 (a mixture of authentic traditional instrumentation with MIDI, sampling and sequencing, plus contributions from Dave Stewart). Despite declaring in 2004 that he \"\"personally (had) nothing to say in the western musical language\"\" Campbell followed it up in 2009 with \"\"Music from a Walled Garden\"\". He has gone on to record as half of The World Wind Band (the other half being fellow multi-wind player Jan Hendrickse) and currently plays and composes as part of the \"\"non-European folk\"\" band Kalamus, which he's described as \"\"mostly flute and bagpipe music with percussion\"\" and which released their first album \"\"Bronze\"\" in 2011.\nQuestion: who wrote round and round by tevin campbell\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Battle of Cold Harbor\" Text:  Both Grant and Lee, whose armies had suffered enormous casualties in the Overland Campaign, received reinforcements. On the evening of June 1, the Union VI Corps and XVIII Corps arrived and assaulted the Confederate works to the west of the crossroads with some success. On June 2, the remainder of both armies arrived and the Confederates built an elaborate series of fortifications 7 miles long. At dawn on June 3, three Union corps attacked the Confederate works on the southern end of the line and were easily repulsed with heavy casualties.\n[2] Title: \"Battle of Cold Harbor\" Text:  Once Hancock was in position, Meade would attack on his left from Old Cold Harbor with three Union corps in line, totaling 35,000 men: Hancock's II Corps, Wright's VI Corps, and Baldy Smith's XVIII Corps. Meade also ordered Warren and Burnside to attack Lee's left flank in the morning \"\"at all hazards,\"\" convinced 9.</ref> Hancock's men marched almost all night and arrived too worn-out for an immediate attack that morning. Grant agreed to let the men rest and postponed the attack until 5 p.m., and then again until 4:30 a.m. on June 3.\n[3] Title: \"Battle of Cold Harbor\" Text:  Meade was also concerned about his left flank, which was not anchored on the Chickahominy and was potentially threatened by Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry. He ordered Phil Sheridan to send scouting parties into the area, but Sheridan resisted, telling Meade that it would be impossible to move his men before dark. At 6:30 p.m. the attack that Grant had ordered for the morning finally began. Both Wright's and Smith's corps moved forward. Wright's men made little progress south of the Mechanicsville Road, which connected New and Old Cold Harbor, recoiling from heavy fire.\n[4] Title: \"Battle of Cold Harbor\" Text:  Although the June 1 attacks had been unsuccessful, Meade believed that an attack early on June 2 could succeed if he was able to mass sufficient forces against an appropriate location. He and Grant decided to attack Lee's right flank. Anderson's men had been heavily engaged there on June 1, and it seemed unlikely that they had found the time to build substantial defenses. And if the attack succeeded, Lee's right would be driven back into the Chickahominy River. Meade ordered Hancock's II Corps to shift southeast from Totopotomoy Creek and assume a position to the left of Wright's VI Corps.\n[5] Title: \"Battle of Cold Harbor\" Text:  After Grant's infantry had crossed to the south bank of the Pamunkey, Lee saw an opportunity on May 30 to attack Warren's advancing V Corps with his Second Corps, now commanded by Lt. Gen. Jubal Early. Early's divisions under Maj. Gens. Robert E. Rodes and Stephen Dodson Ramseur drove the Union troops back in the Battle of Bethesda Church, but Ramseur's advance was stopped by a fierce stand of infantry and artillery fire. On that same day, a small cavalry engagement at Matadequin Creek (the Battle of Old Church) drove an outnumbered Confederate cavalry brigade to the crossroads of Old Cold Harbor, verifying to Lee that Grant intended to move toward that vital intersection beyond Lee's right flank, attempting to avoid another stalemate on the Totopotomoy Creek line.\nQuestion: who attacked first in the battle of cold harbor\nYour answer: ",

The first regularly scheduled television service in the United States began on July 2, 1928, fifteen months before the United Kingdom. The Federal Radio Commission authorized C. F. Jenkins to broadcast from experimental station W3XK in Wheaton, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. For at least the first eighteen months, 48-line silhouette images from motion picture film were broadcast, although beginning in the summer of 1929 he occasionally broadcast in halftones. Hugo Gernsback's New York City radio station began a regular, if limited, schedule of live television broadcasts on August 14, 1928, using 48-line images.\n[2] Title: \"David Sarnoff\" Text:  Finally, in April 1939, regularly scheduled, electronic television in America was initiated by RCA under the name of their broadcasting division at the time, The National Broadcasting Company (NBC). The first television broadcast aired was the dedication of the RCA pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fairgrounds and was introduced by Sarnoff himself. Later that month on April 30, opening day ceremonies at The World's Fair were telecast in the medium's first major production, featuring a speech by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the first US President to appear on television.\n[3] Title: \"History of television\" Text:  On July 7, 1936 RCA and its subsidiary NBC demonstrated in New York City a 343-line electronic television broadcast with live and film segments to its licensees, and made its first public demonstration to the press on November 6. Irregularly scheduled broadcasts continued through 1937 and 1938. Regularly scheduled electronic broadcasts began in April 1938 in New York (to the second week of June, and resuming in August) and Los Angeles. NBC officially began regularly scheduled television broadcasts in New York on April 30, 1939, with a broadcast of the opening of the 1939 New York World's Fair.\n[4] Title: NBC Text:  DuMont Laboratories (and others) had actually offered the first home sets in 1938 in anticipation of NBC's announced April 1939 television launch. Later in 1939, NBC took its cameras to professional football and baseball games in the New York City area, establishing many \"\"firsts\"\" in television broadcasting. Reportedly, the first NBC Television \"\"network\"\" program was broadcast on January 12, 1940, when a play titled \"\"Meet The Wife\"\" was originated at the W2XBS studios at Rockefeller Center and rebroadcast by W2XB/W2XAF (now WRGB) in Schenectady, which received the New York station directly off-air from a tower atop a mountain and relayed the live signal to the Capital District.\n[5] Title: \"History of television\" Text:  The first broadcast included Mayor Jimmy Walker, the Boswell Sisters, Kate Smith, and George Gershwin. The service ended in February 1933. Don Lee Broadcasting's station W6XAO in Los Angeles went on the air in December 1931. Using the UHF spectrum, it broadcast a regular schedule of filmed images every day except Sundays and holidays for several years. By 1935, low-definition electromechanical television broadcasting had ceased in the United States except for a handful of stations run by public universities that continued to 1939. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) saw television in the continual flux of development with no consistent technical standards, hence all such stations in the U.S. were granted only experimental and non-commercial licenses, hampering television's economic development.\nQuestion: when did the first tv come out in the us\nYour answer: ",

This was when hurricane reconnaissance planes were sent out to fly across the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico on a routine basis to look for potential tropical cyclones, in the years before the continuous weather satellite era. Since regular satellite surveillance began, hurricane hunter aircraft fly only into storm areas which are first spotted by satellite imagery. During the hurricane season, the National Hurricane Center routinely issues their Tropical Weather Outlook product, which identifies areas of concern within the tropics which could develop into tropical cyclones.\n[2] Title: \"Atlantic hurricane\" Text:  Climatologically speaking, approximately 97 percent of tropical cyclones that form in the North Atlantic develop between the dates of June 1 and November 30 \u2013 dates which delimit the modern-day Atlantic hurricane season. Though the beginning of the annual hurricane season has historically remained the same, the official end of the hurricane season has shifted from its initial date of October 31. Regardless, on average once every few years a tropical cyclone develops outside the limits of the season; as of January 2016 there have been 68 tropical cyclones in the off-season, with the most recent being Subtropical Storm Alberto in 2018.\n[3] Title: \"1965 Atlantic hurricane season\" Text:  The final tropical cyclone, Hurricane Elena, formed on October 12. Elena remained at sea for nearly a week and caused no damage on land. Collectively, the storms of the 1965 Atlantic hurricane season caused 76 fatalities and $1.45 billion in damage, almost entirely due to Hurricane Betsy. The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1965. This was the first Atlantic hurricane season to start on June 1 and end on November 30, which is the modern-day season bounds. It was a below average season in which six tropical depressions formed.\n[4] Title: \"1993 Atlantic hurricane season\" Text:  1993 Atlantic hurricane season The 1993 Atlantic hurricane season was a below average Atlantic hurricane season that produced ten tropical cyclones, eight tropical storms, four hurricanes, and one major hurricane. It officially started on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. The first tropical cyclone, Tropical Depression One, developed on May 31, while the final storm, Tropical Depression Ten, dissipated on September 30, well before the average dissipation date of a season's last tropical cyclone; this represented the earliest end to the hurricane season in ten years.\n[5] Title: \"2004 Atlantic hurricane season\" Text:  The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30, though the season's last storm, Otto, dissipated on December 3, extending the season beyond its traditional boundaries. The first storm, Alex, developed offshore of the Southeastern United States on July 31, one of the latest dates on record to see the formation of the first system in an Atlantic hurricane season. It brushed the Carolinas and the Mid-Atlantic, causing one death and $7.5 million (2004 USD) in damage.

The Canadian art-rock group The Rheostatics recorded a version of the song for their 1991 album \"\"Melville.\"\" In 1995, two decades after Lightfoot's original song was written, singer-songwriter Camille West recorded a parody song with a similar rhythm titled \"\"The Nervous Wreck of Edna Fitzgerald\"\", about a well-to-do family's disastrous day at sea.\n[5] Title: \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\" Text:  Overseas it was at best a minor hit, peaking at number 40 in the UK Singles Chart. The song is written in Dorian mode. Lightfoot re-recorded the song in 1988 for the compilation album \"\"Gord's Gold, Vol. 2\"\". The song contains a few artistic omissions and paraphrases. In a later interview aired on Canadian commercial radio, Lightfoot recounted how he had agonised while trying to pen the lyrics over possible inaccuracies until Lenny Waronker, his long-time producer and friend, finally removed his writer's block simply by advising him to play to his artistic strengths and \"\"just tell a story\"\".\nQuestion: who sings the wreck of the edmund fitzgerald\nYour answer: ",

In the early 2000s, Astin played Samwise Gamgee in Peter Jackson's \"\"The Lord of the Rings\"\" film trilogy, consisting of (2001), (2002), and (2003).\n[3] Title: \"The Lord of the Rings (film series)\" Text:  Set in the fictional world of Middle-earth, the films follow the hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) as he and the Fellowship embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring, and thus ensure the destruction of its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron. The Fellowship eventually splits up and Frodo continues the quest together with his loyal companion Sam (Sean Astin) and the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis). Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, Pippin, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) unite to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth in the War of the Ring.\n[4] Title: \"The Lord of the Rings (film series)\" Text:  15, Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf ranking No. 30, Ian Holm's portrayal of Bilbo Baggins (shared with Martin Freeman for his portrayal of the same character in \"\"The Hobbit\"\" films) ranking No. 61, Andy Serkis' portrayal of Gollum ranking No. 66, Sean Astin's portrayal of Samwise Gamgee ranking No. 77, and Orlando Bloom's portrayal of Legolas ranking No. 94.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Thanksgiving (United States)\" Text:  Since 1947, the National Turkey Federation has presented the President of the United States with one live turkey and two dressed turkeys, in a ceremony known as the National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation. John F. Kennedy was the first president reported to spare the turkey given to him (he announced he didn't plan to eat the bird), and Ronald Reagan was the first to grant the turkey a presidential pardon, which he jokingly presented to his 1987 turkey (a turkey that would indeed be spared and sent to a petting zoo).\n[2] Title: \"National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation\" Text:  Likewise, Richard Nixon also spared some of the turkeys given to him during his time as President. Jimmy Carter refused to take part in the presentation and rejected the turkeys given to him. First Lady Rosalyn Carter arranged to have the turkeys sent to petting zoos. The first President on record issuing a \"\"pardon\"\" to his turkey was Ronald Reagan. Reagan had been sending the turkeys presented to him to farms and zoos since at least 1982, and 1987's turkey, Charlie, was likewise headed to a petting zoo.\n[3] Title: \"National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation\" Text:  The official presentation of a turkey to the President each year began in 1947 under President Harry Truman, and many sources erroneously attribute the origin of the turkey pardon to Truman. However, the Truman Library says that no documents, speeches, newspaper clippings, photographs or other contemporary records are known to exist that specify that he ever \"\"pardoned\"\" a turkey; the first official turkey pardoning was with President George H. W. Bush. There are records that Truman publicly admitted to eating at least some of them. The presentation was partially borne out of a lobbying campaign: the Truman Administration, in an effort to conserve grain for foreign aid campaigns, began promoting \"\"Meatless Tuesdays\"\" and \"\"Poultryless Thursdays\"\" in the autumn of 1947.\n[4] Title: \"National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation\" Text:  The ceremony dates back to the 1940s, with presidents occasionally sparing the bird presented to them; since 1989, during George H. W. Bush's first Thanksgiving as president, it has been an annual tradition for the president to \"\"pardon\"\" the turkey. It's a tradition that the turkeys be picked from the chairman of the NTF's home state. On various occasions, turkeys had been donated to the President as gifts from private citizens. Henry Vose, a Rhode Island turkey farmer, presented a turkey to the President each year from 1873 until his death in 1913.\n[5] Title: \"President of the United States\" Text:  The President of the United States has served as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America since the founding of the organization. Other presidential traditions are associated with American holidays. Rutherford B. Hayes began in 1878 the first White House egg rolling for local children. Beginning in 1947, during the Harry S. Truman administration, every Thanksgiving the president is presented with a live domestic turkey during the annual National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation held at the White House. Since 1989, when the custom of \"\"pardoning\"\" the turkey was formalized by George H. W. Bush, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.\nQuestion: who was the first president to pardon the turkey\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Klavarskribo Text:  The stave on which the notes are written is vertical so the music is read from top to bottom. Each note has its own individual position, low notes on the left and high notes on the right as on the piano. This stave consists of groups of two and three vertical lines corresponding to the black keys (notes) of the piano. White notes are written in the seven white spaces between the lines. Therefore sharps and flats are no longer needed, as each note has its own place in the octave.\n[2] Title: Clef Text:  Each type of clef assigns its reference note to a line (and in rare cases, a space) depending on its placement on the stave. Once one of these clefs has been placed on one of the lines of the stave, the other lines and spaces are read in relation to it. The use of three different clefs makes it possible to write music for all instruments and voices, regardless of differences in tessitura. Because the modern stave has only five lines, it is not possible to represent all pitches playable by the orchestra with only one clef, even with the use of ledger lines.\n[3] Title: \"Staff (music)\" Text:  The notehead can be placed with its center intersecting a line (\"\"on a line\"\") or in between the lines touching the lines above and below (\"\"in a space\"\"). Notes outside the range of the staff are placed on or between ledger lines\u2014lines the width of the note they need to hold\u2014added above or below the staff. Which staff positions represent which notes is determined by a clef placed at the beginning of the staff. The clef identifies a particular line as a specific note, and all other notes are determined relative to that line.\n[4] Title: Gravikord Text:  It can be done directly from the music using a mental method. Because of its double structure and symmetric tuning system, all the notes on one side of the bridge correspond to the lines of the musical staff and all the notes on the other side correspond to the staff spaces. So, whatever key the music is written in, determine where the root note is of the scale. The method is then to mentally let this be the position of the instruments root note \"\"G\"\" for example. If the written note is on a staff line, let that staff line represent the \"\"G\"\" string on the gravikord and all the other strings on that side of the bridge will correspond spatially and sequentially to the other staff lines, all the notes on the opposite side of the bridge will correspond spatially and sequentially to the staff spaces.\n[5] Title: \"Transposition (music)\" Text:  One imagines a different clef and a different key signature than the ones printed. The change of clef is used so that the lines and spaces correspond to different notes than the lines and spaces of the original score. Seven clefs are used for this: treble (2nd line G-clef), bass (4th line F-clef), baritone (3rd line F-clef or 5th line C-clef, although in France and Belgium sight-reading exercises for this clef, as a preparation for clef transposition practice, are always printed with the 3rd line F-clef), and C-clefs on the four lowest lines; these allow any given staff position to correspond to each of the seven note names A through G. The signature is then adjusted for the actual accidental (natural, sharp or flat) one wants on that note.\nQuestion: the collection of parallel lines and spaces on which notes are written\nYour answer: ",

It is an adaptation of the Goldthorpe schema which was first known as the Nuffield Class Schema developed in the 1970s. It was developed using the Standard Occupational Classification 1990 (SOC90) and rebased on the Standard Occupational Classification 2000 (SOC2000) before its first major use on the 2001 UK census. The NS-SEC replaced two previous social classifications: Socio-economic Groups (SEG) and Social Class based on Occupation (SC, formerly known as Registrar General's Social Class, RGSC).\n[2] Title: \"National Statistics Socio-economic Classification\" Text:  The NS-SEC was rebased on the Standard Occupational Classification 2010 prior to the 2011 UK census and it will be further rebased on the new Standard Occupational Classification 2020 for use on the 2021 UK census. The NS-SEC is a nested classification. It has 14 operational categories, with some sub-categories, and is commonly used in eight-class, five-class, and three-class versions. Only the three-category version is intended to represent any form of hierarchy. The version intended for most users (the analytic version) has eight classes: The three-class version is reduced to following: National Statistics Socio-economic Classification The National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (often abbreviated to\n[3] Title: \"Financial audit\" Text:  The Australian National Audit Office conducts all financial statement audits for entities controlled by the Australian Government.

The SIC system is also used by agencies in other countries, e.g., by the United Kingdom's Companies House. In the United States the SIC code is being supplanted by the six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS code), which was released in 1997; however certain government departments and agencies, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), still use the SIC codes.\nQuestion: what is the uk equivalent of the sec\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"French orthography\" Text:  Later attempts to respell some words in accordance with their Latin etymologies further increased the number of silent letters (e.g., ' vs. older ' \u2013 compare English \"\"tense\"\", which reflects the original spelling \u2013 and ' vs. older '). Nevertheless, there are rules governing French orthography which allow for a reasonable degree of accuracy when pronouncing French words from their written forms. The reverse operation, producing written forms from a pronunciation, is much more ambiguous. The French alphabet is based on the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, uppercase and lowercase, with five diacritics and two orthographic ligatures.\n[2] Title: \"French language\" Text:  In a study published in March 2014 by \"\"Forbes\"\", the investment bank Natixis said that French could become the world's most spoken language by 2050. It noted that French is spreading in areas where the population is rapidly increasing, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Although there are many French regional accents, foreign learners normally use only one variety of the language. French pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology. The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are: French is written with the 26 letters of the basic Latin script, with four diacritics appearing on vowels (circumflex accent, acute accent, grave accent, diaeresis) and the cedilla appearing in \"\"\u00e7\"\".\n[3] Title: \"French orthography\" Text:  In the second case, a digraph is due to an archaic pronunciation, such as , , , , and , or is merely a convenient way to expand the twenty-six-letter alphabet to cover all relevant phonemes, as in , , , , , and . Some cases are a mixture of these or are used for purely pragmatic reasons, such as for in \"\"il mangeait\"\" ('he ate'), where the serves to indicate a \"\"soft\"\" inherent in the verb's root. The spelling of French words of Greek origin is complicated by a number of digraphs which originated in the Latin transcriptions.\n[4] Title: \"Superior letter\" Text:  With the coming of printing, pieces of type were cast to enable them to appear in print. These are still commonly used in French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, though their appearance in English has diminished. Not every letter in the alphabet has a piece of type cast for it as a superior letter. In the book \"\"Thinking in Type\"\", by Alex W. White, it is stated that there are only twelve superior letters used in French and Spanish: a, b, d, e, i, l, m, n, o, r, s, and t. In English, however, 'h' is also sometimes rendered as a superior letter, as in 6th.\n[5] Title: Braille Text:  The next ten letters, \"\"k\u2013t,\"\" are identical to \"\"a\u2013j,\"\" respectively, apart from the addition of a dot at position 3 (red dots in the table): : The next ten letters (the next \"\"decade\"\") are the same again, but with dots also at positions both 3 and 6 (green dots).

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"The Canterbury Tales\" Text:  Chaucer was a courtier, leading some to believe that he was mainly a court poet who wrote exclusively for nobility. \"\"The Canterbury Tales\"\" is generally thought to have been incomplete at the end of Chaucer's life. In the General Prologue, some 30 pilgrims are introduced. According to the Prologue, Chaucer's intention was to write four stories from the perspective of each pilgrim, two each on the way to and from their ultimate destination, St. Thomas Becket's shrine (making for a total of about 120 stories).\n[2] Title: \"Pilgrims' Way\" Text:  Indeed, this was the route taken by Henry II on his pilgrimage of atonement for the death of Bishop Thomas from France to Canterbury in July 1174. Travellers from Winchester to Canterbury naturally used the ancient way, as it was the direct route, and research by local historians has provided much by way of detail\u2014sometimes embellished\u2014of the pilgrims' journeys. The numbers making their way to Canterbury by this route were not recorded, but the estimate by the Kentish historian William Coles Finch that it carried more than 100,000 pilgrims a year is surely an exaggeration.\n[3] Title: \"Pilgrims' Way\" Text:  A separate (and more reliably attested) route to Canterbury from London was by way of Watling Street, as followed by the storytellers in \"\"The Canterbury Tales\"\" by Geoffrey Chaucer. Conversely, the concept of a single route called the Pilgrims' Way could be no older than the Victorian Ordnance Survey map of Surrey, whose surveyor, Edward Renouard James, published a pamphlet in 1871 entitled \"\"Notes on the Pilgrims' Way in West Surrey\"\". Here he asserted that the route was \"\"little studied\"\" and that \"\"very many persons in the neighbourhood\"\" had not been aware of it.\n[4] Title: Canterbury Text:  In the early 12th century, the castle was rebuilt with stone. After the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket at the cathedral in 1170, Canterbury became one of the most notable towns in Europe, as pilgrims from all parts of Christendom came to visit his shrine. This pilgrimage provided the framework for Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th-century collection of stories, \"\"The Canterbury Tales\"\". Canterbury Castle was captured by the French Prince Louis during his 1215 invasion of England, before the death of John caused his English supporters to desert his cause and support the young Henry III.\n[5] Title: \"The Canterbury Tales\" Text:  Miracle stories connected to his remains sprang up soon after his death, and the cathedral became a popular pilgrimage destination. The pilgrimage in the work ties all of the stories together and may be considered a representation of Christians' striving for heaven, despite weaknesses, disagreement, and diversity of opinion. The upper class or nobility, represented chiefly by the Knight and his Squire, was in Chaucer's time steeped in a culture of chivalry and courtliness. Nobles were expected to be powerful warriors who could be ruthless on the battlefield yet mannerly in the King's Court and Christian in their actions.\nQuestion: how many pilgrims were on the pilgrimage in the canterbury tales\nYour answer: ",

After he explains how it works (including a \"\"non-return key\"\" that keeps the machine at the traveler's destination and a \"\"vaporizing equalizer\"\" that keeps the traveler and machine on equal terms), police constables arrive at the house searching for Jack the Ripper. A bag with blood-stained gloves belonging to one of Herbert's friends, a surgeon named John Leslie Stevenson, leads them to conclude that Stevenson might be the infamous killer.\n[3] Title: \"Time After Time (1979 film)\" Text:  Using Amy's car, Herbert follows them back to the museum. While Herbert bargains for Amy's life, she is able to escape. As Stevenson starts up the time machine, Herbert removes the \"\"vaporizing equalizer\"\" from it, causing Stevenson to vanish while the machine does not. As Herbert had explained earlier, this causes the machine to remain in place while its passenger is sent traveling endlessly through time with no way to stop; in effect, he is destroyed. Herbert proclaims that the time has come to return to his own time, in order to destroy a machine that he now knows is too dangerous for primitive mankind.\n[4] Title: \"Time After Time (1979 film)\" Text:  On May 12, 2016, the ABC television network announced that it had picked up a \"\"Time After Time\"\" television series to air in the 2016\u20132017 television season. The series, executive produced and written by Kevin Williamson, was cancelled after only five episodes. Time After Time (1979 film) Time After Time is a 1979 American Metrocolor science fiction film directed by screenwriter Nicholas Meyer and starring Malcolm McDowell, David Warner, and Mary Steenburgen. Filmed in Panavision, it was the directing debut of Meyer, whose screenplay is based on the premise from Karl Alexander's novel \"\"Time After Time\"\" (which was unfinished at the time) and a story by Alexander and Steve Hayes.\n[5] Title: \"Time After Time (1979 film)\" Text:  \"\"Time After Time\"\" received a positive response from critics. \"\"Variety\"\" described the film as \"\"a delightful, entertaining trifle of a film that shows both the possibilities and limitations of taking liberties with literature and history. Nicholas Meyer has deftly juxtaposed Victorian England and contemporary America in a clever story, irresistible due to the competence of its cast\"\". Janet Maslin of \"\"The New York Times\"\" similarly lauded, \"\"\"\"Time After Time\"\" is every bit as magical as the trick around which it revolves\"\".\nQuestion: movie at the beginning of time after time\nYour answer: ",

A fat is made of two kinds of smaller molecules: glycerol and fatty acids. Fats are made of long chains of carbon (C) atoms. Some carbon atoms are linked by single bonds (-C-C-) and others are linked by double bonds (-C=C-). Double bonds can react with hydrogen to form single bonds. They are called saturated, because the second bond is broken up and each half of the bond is attached to (saturated with) a hydrogen atom.\n[2] Title: \"Saturated fat\" Text:  Carbon atoms are also implicitly drawn, as they are portrayed as intersections between two straight lines. \"\"Saturated,\"\" in general, refers to a maximum number of hydrogen atoms bonded to each carbon of the polycarbon tail as allowed by the Octet Rule. This also means that only single bonds (sigma bonds) will be present between adjacent carbon atoms of the tail.

Double\n[4] Title: \"Trans fat\" Text:  Only unsaturated fats can be \"\"trans\"\" \"\"or\"\" \"\"cis\"\" fat, since only a double bond can be locked to these orientations. Saturated fatty acids are never called \"\"trans fats\"\" because they have no double bonds. Thus, all their bonds are freely rotatable. Other types of fatty acids, such as crepenynic acid, which contains a triple bond, are rare and of no nutritional significance. Carbon atoms are tetravalent, forming four covalent bonds with other atoms, whereas hydrogen atoms bond with only one other atom.\n[5] Title: \"Trans fat\" Text:  In saturated fatty acids, each carbon atom (besides the last) is connected to its two neighbour carbon atoms and to two hydrogen atoms. In unsaturated fatty acids, the carbon atoms that are missing a hydrogen atom are joined by double bonds rather than single bonds so that each carbon atom participates in four bonds. Hydrogenation of an unsaturated fatty acid refers to the addition of hydrogen atoms to the acid, causing double bonds to become single ones, as carbon atoms acquire new hydrogen partners (to maintain four bonds per carbon atom).\nQuestion: what kind of bonds do saturated fats have\nYour answer: ",

It is located near Burnsville in Yancey County, North Carolina, in the Black Mountain subrange of the Appalachians, and about northeast of Asheville. It is protected by Mount Mitchell State Park and surrounded by the Pisgah National Forest. Mount Mitchell's elevation is above sea level. The peak is the highest mountain in the United States east of the Mississippi River, and the highest in all of eastern North America south of the Arctic Cordillera.\n[2] Title: \"North Carolina\" Text:  The Black Mountains are the highest in the eastern United States, and culminate in Mount Mitchell at , the highest point east of the Mississippi River. North Carolina has 17 major river basins. The five basins west of the Blue Ridge Mountains flow to the Gulf of Mexico, while the remainder flow to the Atlantic Ocean. Of the 17 basins, 11 originate within the state of North Carolina, but only four are contained entirely within the state's border \u2013 the Cape Fear, the Neuse, the White Oak, and the Tar\u2013Pamlico basin.\n[3] Title: \"Black Mountains (North Carolina)\" Text:  After measuring Celo Knob, Mitchell descended to the Cane River Valley to obtain advice from the valley's residents. Two local guides (one of whom was William Wilson, a cousin of the later renowned mountain guide, Thomas \"\"Big Tom\"\" Wilson) led Mitchell up a bear trail to what they believed to be the highest summit. Although exactly which mountain they summited has long been disputed, it was likely Mount Gibbes, Clingmans Peak, or Mount Mitchell. Nevertheless, Mitchell obtained a measurement of (later determined to be too low), placing the Blacks at a higher elevation than Mount Washington and thus the highest in the Eastern United States.\n[4] Title: \"Elisha Mitchell\" Text:  In 1835, he first measured the height of this mountain, at the time known as Black Dome. Through subsequent measurements in 1838 and 1844, Mitchell proved it was higher than New Hampshire\u2019s Mount Washington, establishing the peak as the highest above sea level in the Eastern US. Elisha Mitchell fell to his death at nearby Mitchell Falls in 1857, having returned to verify his earlier measurements, which had been challenged by state senator Thomas Clingman, a former student of Mitchell\u2019s. He was originally buried in Asheville, but was reinterred in a tomb on the mountain in 1858.\n[5] Title: \"Black Mountains (North Carolina)\" Text:  In the early 19th century, Mount Washington in New Hampshire was believed to be the highest summit in the Eastern United States, an assumption many North Carolinians began to question in light of Michaux's findings (Michaux believed that Grandfather Mountain was the highest). In 1835, the state dispatched North Carolina professor Elisha Mitchell (1793\u20131857) into the western part of the state to measure the elevation of Grandfather, the Roan Highlands, and the Black Mountains. Using a crude barometer, Mitchell gained measurements for Grandfather and Roan with apparent ease, although he struggled to discern which of the Blacks was the highest.\nQuestion: what is the highest peak in the eastern us\nYour answer: ",

She was two or three at the time. Miss Havisham did not know where she came from and named her Estella. Jaggers advises Pip to be quiet about it. For whose sake would he tell it? The father had to keep in hiding, the mother had been about to kill the child and the daughter had escaped disgrace and would be dragged back into it by the revelation.\n[4] Title: \"Estella (Great Expectations)\" Text:  The second ending echoes strongly the theme of closure found in much of the novel; Pip and Estella's relationship at the end is marked by some sadness and some joy, and although Estella still indicates that she doesn't believe she and Pip will be together, Pip perceives that she will stay with him: Though she never knows it herself, Pip finally finds out where Estella comes from. She was the child of Jaggers's maidservant Molly, a gypsy at that time, and Abel Magwitch.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"History of psychology\" Text:  Psychology was a branch of the domain of philosophy until the 1870s, when it developed as an independent scientific discipline in Germany and the United States. Psychology as a self-conscious field of experimental study began in 1879, in Leipzig Germany, when Wilhelm Wundt founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research in Germany. Wundt was also the first person to refer to himself as \"\"a psychologist\"\". Other important early contributors to the field include Hermann Ebbinghaus (a pioneer in the study of memory), William James (the American father of pragmatism), and Ivan Pavlov (who developed the procedures associated with classical conditioning).\n[2] Title: \"History of science\" Text:  The end of the 19th century marks the start of psychology as a scientific enterprise. The year 1879 is commonly seen as the start of psychology as an independent field of study. In that year Wilhelm Wundt founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research (in Leipzig). Other important early contributors to the field include Hermann Ebbinghaus (a pioneer in memory studies), Ivan Pavlov (who discovered classical conditioning), William James, and Sigmund Freud. Freud's influence has been enormous, though more as cultural icon than a force in scientific psychology.\n[3] Title: Cognition Text:  Two millennia later, as psychology emerged as a burgeoning field of study in Europe and then gained a following in America, other scientists like Wilhelm Wundt, Herman Ebbinghaus, Mary Whiton Calkins, and William James would offer their contributions to the study of human cognition. Wilhelm Wundt (1832\u20131920) emphasized the notion of what he called introspection: examining the inner feelings of an individual. With introspection, the subject had to be careful to describe his or her feelings in the most objective manner possible in order for Wundt to find the information scientific.\n[4] Title: \"Behavioral neuroscience\" Text:  Descartes also elaborated on a theory in which the pneumatics of bodily fluids could explain reflexes and other motor behavior. This theory was inspired by moving statues in a garden in Paris. Other philosophers also helped give birth to psychology. One of the earliest textbooks in the new field, \"\"The Principles of Psychology\"\" by William James, argues that the scientific study of psychology should be grounded in an understanding of biology: The emergence of both psychology and behavioral neuroscience as legitimate sciences can be traced from the emergence of physiology from anatomy, particularly neuroanatomy.\n[5] Title: \"Cognitive neuroscience\" Text:  Andreas Vesalius, an anatomist and physician, was the first to believe that the brain and the nervous system are the center of the mind and emotion. Psychology, a major contributing field to cognitive neuroscience, emerged from philosophical reasoning about the mind. One of the predecessors to cognitive neuroscience was phrenology, a pseudoscientific approach that claimed that behavior could be determined by the shape of the scalp. In the early 19th century, Franz Joseph Gall and J. G. Spurzheim believed that the human brain was localized into approximately 35 different sections.\nQuestion: psychology emerged as a science from the field of\nYour answer: ",

Agrigentum's Carthaginian garrison under Hanno engaged Marcellus at the river Himera and were crushed. In 211 BC, Rome countered the Macedonian threat with a Greek alliance of the Aetolians, Elis, Sparta, Messenia and Attalus I of Pergamon, as well as two Roman clients, the Illyrians Pleuratus and Scerdilaidas.

The Carthaginians were led by Hasdrubal Barca, brother of Hannibal, who was to have brought siege equipment and reinforcements for Hannibal. The Roman armies were led by the consuls Marcus Livius, who was later nicknamed the Salinator, and Gaius Claudius Nero. Claudius Nero had just fought Hannibal in Grumentum, some hundreds of kilometers south of the Metaurus river, and reached Marcus Livius by a forced march that went unnoticed by both Hannibal and Hasdrubal, so that the Carthaginians suddenly found themselves outnumbered.\n[5] Title: \"Second Punic War\" Text:  After 217 BC, he moved to Iberia. Gnaeus Scipio landed his army at Cissa and won increasing support among the natives. The Carthaginian commander in the area, Hanno, refused to wait for Carthaginian reinforcements under Hasdrubal, attacked Scipio at the Battle of Cissa in late 218 BC and was defeated. The combined Roman and Massalian fleet and army posed a threat to the Carthaginians. In 217 BC, Hasdrubal moved up to engage them at the Battle of Ebro River.

The trio debuted on MBC's talent show with their song \"\"Nan Arayo\"\" (\ub09c \uc54c\uc544\uc694, I Know) and got the lowest rating from the jury; however, the song and album of the same name became so successful that it paved the way for other songs of the same format. The song's success was attributed to its new jack swing-inspired beats and memorable chorus, as well as innovative lyrics which dealt with the problems of Korean society.\n[2] Title: K-pop Text:  The more modern form of the genre emerged with the formation of one of the earliest K-pop groups, Seo Taiji and Boys, in 1992. Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea's contemporary music scene. Modern K-pop \"\"idol\"\" culture began with the boy band H.O.T. in 1996, as K-pop grew into a subculture that amassed enormous fandoms of teenagers and young adults.

The group incorporated American-style hip hop and R&B into their music, a move that was so influential that they are considered the originators of modern K-pop, and their explosive popularity paved the way for both pop and hip hop artists in Korea. Other popular groups who helped spread hip hop into the Korean mainstream in the early 1990s include Deux and DJ DOC.

Gonzalez set a Spanish record of 3:30.92 minutes and a few weeks later also ran a new record over one mile in 3:47.79 min.\n[4] Title: \"Jules Ladoume\u0300gue\" Text:  He struggled through the final homestretch, later saying \"\"My legs were like lead in that final lap.\"\" He crossed the line and three watches recorded his time as 3:49 1/5, two at 3:49.0. The slower time was taken as the official time, and Ladoum\u00e8gue not only had the record, he became the first sub-3:50 1500 m runner. He repeated his record-setting ways by running the 1000 m in 2:23.6 on the same Paris track 19 October. In 1931, his early season was relatively pedestrian as the fastest 1500 m race he ran was 3:58.0 by July.\n[5] Title: \"Sai\u0308d Aouita\" Text:  Later that year, he broke the world record for the same distance in K\u00f6ln, Germany with the time of 7:29.45 and thus, he was the first man in history to go under 7:30:00. Aouita was a versatile middle and long distance runner, excelling at distances between 800 m and 10,000 m during the eighties. He raced and won against the Olympic champions Joaquim Cruz (800 m), Peter Rono (1500 m), John Ngugi (5000 m) and Alberto Cova (10000 m) over their respective main distances.\nQuestion: who is the first fastest runner in the world\nYour answer: ",

These cells are located in the gastric glands found in the lining of the fundus and in the cardia of the stomach. They contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the HCl is secreted by active transport into the stomach. The enzyme hydrogen potassium ATPase (H/K ATPase) is unique to the parietal cells and transports the H against a concentration gradient of about 3 million to 1, which is the steepest ion gradient formed in the human body.\n[2] Title: \"Parietal cell\" Text:  Atrophic gastritis, particularly in the elderly, will cause an inability to absorb B and can lead to deficiencies such as decreased DNA synthesis and nucleotide metabolism in the bone marrow. Parietal cell Parietal cells (also known as oxyntic or delomorphous cells) are the epithelial cells that secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl) and intrinsic factor.

The acidity aids in digestion of food by promoting the unfolding (or denaturing) of ingested proteins. As proteins unfold, the peptide bonds linking component amino acids are exposed. Gastric HCl simultaneously cleaves pepsinogen, a zymogen, into active pepsin, an endopeptidase that advances the digestive process by breaking the now-exposed peptide bonds, a process known as proteolysis. Parietal cells secrete acid in response to three types of stimuli: Activation of histamine through H receptor causes increases intracellular cAMP level while Ach through M receptor and gastrin through CCK2 receptor increases intracellular calcium level.\n[4] Title: \"Gastrointestinal physiology\" Text:  H and Cl are secreted by the parietal cells into the lumen of the stomach creating acidic conditions with a low pH of 1. H is pumped into the stomach by exchanging it with K. This process also requires ATP as a source of energy; however, Cl then follows the positive charge in the H through an open apical channel protein. HCO secretion occurs to neutralize the acid secretions that make their way into the duodenum of the small intestine. Most of the HCO comes from pancreatic acinar cells in the form of NaHCO in an aqueous solution.\n[5] Title: \"Gastric acid\" Text:  Gastric acid Gastric acid, gastric juice or stomach acid, is a digestive fluid formed in the stomach and is composed of hydrochloric acid (HCl), potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl). The acid plays a key role in digestion of proteins, by activating digestive enzymes, and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids. Gastric acid is produced by cells in the lining of the stomach, which are coupled in feedback systems to increase acid production when needed.\nQuestion: where is hcl secreted in the digestive system\nYour answer: ",

It was considered a specialty item until 1954, when manufacturers introduced the machine more broadly, following a spate of speculative announcements from doctors and researchers concerning a possible link between lung diseases and smoking. Since filtered cigarettes were considered \"\"safer\"\", by the 1960s, they dominated the market. Production of filter cigarettes rose from 0.5 percent in 1950 to 87.7 percent by 1975. Between the 1930s and the 1950s, most cigarettes were 70 mm (~2 3/4 in) long.\n[2] Title: \"Parliament (cigarette)\" Text:  The brand was launched in 1931 and is distinctive for its recessed paper filters.

The brand was launched in 1931 and is distinctive for its recessed paper filters. It was originally used as an advertising gimmick when cigarettes did not have filters. The first commercial cigarette filters came into use in 1935. Parliaments are one of few brands of cigarettes on the mainstream market to feature a recessed paper filter. Cigarette filters became common in most cigarettes in the 1950s.\n[4] Title: \"Marlboro Man\" Text:  Philip Morris & Co. (now Altria) had originally introduced the Marlboro brand as a woman's cigarette in 1924. Starting in the early 1950s, the cigarette industry began to focus on promoting filtered cigarettes, as a response to the emerging scientific data about harmful effects of smoking. Under the impression that filtered cigarettes were safer, Marlboro, as well as other brands, started to be sold with filters. However, filtered cigarettes, Marlboro in particular, were considered to be women\u2019s cigarettes. During market research in the 1950s, men indicated that while they would consider switching to a filtered cigarette, they were concerned about being seen smoking a cigarette marketed to women.\n[5] Title: \"Liggett Group\" Text:  Continuing to innovate, in 1952, Liggett & Myers using Chesterfield became the first to offer cigarettes in two sizes: King and Regular. In 1953, L&M filter cigarettes were introduced. In 1963, Lark charcoal filter cigarettes were introduced. In 1968 the company changed its name to Liggett & Myers, Incorporated. In 1970, the Eve brand was launched in regular and menthol. The company again changed its name in 1976 to Liggett Group, Inc., with Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company as a division.

Ethically, silver also symbolizes greed and degradation of consciousness; this is the negative aspect, the perverting of its value. The abundance of silver in the Earth's crust is 0.08 parts per million, almost exactly the same as that of mercury.\n[2] Title: Silver Text:  Silver coins are produced from cast rods or ingots, rolled to the correct thickness, heat-treated, and then used to cut blanks from. These blanks are then milled and minted in a coining press; modern coining presses can produce 8000 silver coins per hour. As of July 2018, silver is valued at around $495 per kilogram, or about $15.5 per ounce. Silver prices are normally quoted in Troy ounces. One troy ounce is equal to 31.1034 grams. In 2015 China reverted to the metric system and currently prices silver (and gold) in grams.\n[3] Title: \"Dollar coin (United States)\" Text:  They were minted at Philadelphia, New Orleans, Carson City, and San Francisco. A Silver dollar is worth $1 in silver at $1.31 per troy ounce. The current silver price (March 10, 2017) is $17.01 per troy ounce so a silver dollar is worth, in melt value of about $13.15 US. The gold dollar was produced from 1849 to 1889. 1849 to 1853 gold dollar coins were 13 mm across and are called Type I. Type II gold dollars were thinner but larger at 15 mm diameter and were produced from 1854 to 1855.\n[4] Title: \"Pound (currency)\" Text:  Historically, \u00a31 worth of silver coins were a troy pound in weight; in August 2016 this amount of silver was worth approximately \u00a3170 sterling.

On March 16, 2014, he wrote \"\"Coaches have used my 'RICE' guideline for decades, but now it appears that both Ice and complete Rest may delay healing, instead of helping. In a recent study, athletes were told to exercise so intensely that they developed severe muscle damage that caused extensive muscle soreness.\n[3] Title: \"RICE (medicine)\" Text:  Elevation aims to reduce swelling by increasing venous return of blood to the systemic circulation. This will result in less edema which reduces pain and/or swelling. Variations of the acronym are sometimes used, to emphasize additional steps that should be taken. These include: As the Cold or Ice component of RICE and its variations reduces blood flow to the injured area and delays healing, some people argue that for certain types of injuries (such as damage to ligaments and tendons) a protocol that increases blood flow, such as MEAT (Movement, Exercise, Analgesics and Treatments), should be used instead.\n[4] Title: \"Repetitive strain injury\" Text:  RICE stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. RICE is used immediately after an injury happens and for the first 24 to 48 hours after the injury. These modalities can help reduce the swelling and pain. Medications that are most-often prescribed treatments for early-stage RSIs include analgesics, myofeedback, biofeedback, physical therapy, relaxation, and ultrasound therapy. Low-grade RSIs can sometimes resolve themselves if treatments begin shortly after the onset of symptoms. However, some RSIs may require more aggressive intervention including surgery and can persist for years.\n[5] Title: \"Sprained ankle\" Text:  Initial treatment commonly consists of rest, icing, compression and elevation (which is often referred to by the mnemonic RICE or sometimes PRICE with P being \"\"protection\"\"). These elements have been recommended by physicians for decades for the treatment of soft tissue damage, and sprained ankles, one of the most common soft tissue injuries. RICE helps limit the amount of swelling to the area, and \"\"facilitates venous and lymphatic drainage\"\". While nearly universally accepted as a treatment, the National Athletic Trainers Association notes that most of the rationale for using RICE or individual components is based largely on low-quality clinical trials and laboratory studies with uninjured participants or animal models Ice is often used to reduce swelling in cycles of 15\u201320 minutes on and 20\u201330 minutes off.\nQuestion: with regard to the treatment of sports injuries the protocol rice stands for\nYour answer: ",

Recording of the album lasted from 1991 to 1993, first at Ocean Way Recording in Los Angeles, California, then at The Power Station in New York City, New York. Many of the performers from the original album returned for the sequel.

The lead up to the war began with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 which was met with immediate economic sanctions by the United Nations against Iraq. The coalition commenced hostilities in January 1991, resulting in a decisive victory for the U.S. led coalition forces, which drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait with minimal coalition deaths.

During the Iraqi occupation, more than 1,000 Kuwaiti civilians were killed. In addition, more than 600 Kuwaitis went missing during Iraq's occupation, approximately 375 remains were found in mass graves in Iraq.\n[3] Title: \"Kuwait Military Forces\" Text:  U.S. President George H.W.

Louis was officially arrested on 13 August 1792 and sent to the Temple, an ancient fortress in Paris that was used as a prison. On 21 September, the National Assembly declared France to be a Republic and abolished the monarchy. Louis was stripped of all of his titles and honours, and from this date was known as \"\"Citoyen Louis Capet.\"\" The Girondins were partial to keeping the deposed king under arrest, both as a hostage and a guarantee for the future.\n[2] Title: \"Louis XVI of France\" Text:  The credibility of the king was deeply undermined, and the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic became an ever-increasing possibility. Despite his lack of popular approbation, Louis XVI did abolish the death penalty for deserters, as well as the labor tax, which had compelled the French lower classes to spend two weeks out of the year working on buildings and roads. In a context of civil and international war, Louis XVI was suspended and arrested at the time of the Insurrection of 10 August 1792; one month later, the absolute monarchy was abolished; the First French Republic was proclaimed on 21 September 1792.\n[3] Title: \"History of Europe\" Text:  At first the king agreed with these changes and enjoyed reasonable popularity with the people.

Ex-King Louis XVI was convicted of treason and guillotined in January 1793. France had declared war on England and the Dutch Republic in November 1792 and did the same on Spain in March 1793; in the spring of 1793, Austria, Great Britain and the Dutch Republic invaded France; in March, France created a \"\"sister republic\"\" in the \"\"Republic of Mainz\"\".\n[5] Title: \"History of France\" Text:  Right away on 21 September the Convention abolished the monarchy, making France the French First Republic. A new French Republican Calendar was introduced to replace the Christian Gregorian calendar, renaming the year 1792 as year 1 of the Republic. With wars against Prussia and Austria having started earlier in 1792, in November France also declared war on the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic. Ex-king Louis XVI was tried, convicted, and guillotined in January 1793.

Hotmail and Four11's RocketMail both launched in 1996 as free services and immediately became very popular. As the 1990s progressed, and into the 2000s, it became more common for the general public to have access to webmail because: In some cases, webmail application software is developed in-house by the organizations running and managing the application, and in some cases it is obtained from software companies that develop and sell such applications, usually as part of an integrated mail server package (an early example being Netscape Messaging Server).\nQuestion: who founded the first free web based email service hotmail\nYour answer: ",

Colt then renamed and rebranded the rifle \"\"Colt ArmaLite AR-15 Model 01\"\" After a far East tour, Colt made its first sale of Colt ArmaLite AR-15 rifles to Malaya on September 30, 1959. Colt manufactured their first batch of 300 Colt ArmaLite AR-15 rifles in December 1959. Colt would go on to market the Colt ArmaLite AR-15 rifle to military services around the world.\n[2] Title: \"Colt AR-15\" Text:  Colt started selling the semi-automatic version of the M16 rifle as the Colt AR-15 in 1964. The first mass production version was the Colt AR-15 Sporter, in .223 Remington, with a 20-inch barrel and issued with 5-round magazines. Over the decades, Colt has made many different types of AR-15 rifle and carbine models, including the AR-15, AR-15A2, AR-15A3, AR-15A4, and many other models. Although the sale of new AR-15s was banned by the Federal Assault Weapons Ban from 1994 to 2004, Colt and others continued to sell legally compliant versions during that period.\n[3] Title: \"ArmaLite AR-15\" Text:  After modifications (most notably, the charging handle was re-located from under the carrying handle like AR-10 to the rear of the receiver), Colt rebranded it the Colt ArmaLite AR-15. Colt marketed the redesigned rifle to various military services around the world and it was subsequently adopted by the U.S. military as the M16 rifle, which went into production in March 1964. Colt continued to use the AR-15 trademark for its line of semi-automatic-only rifles marketed to civilian and law-enforcement customers, known as Colt AR-15. The Armalite AR-15 is the parent of a variety of Colt AR-15 & M16 rifle variants.\n[4] Title: \"ArmaLite AR-15\" Text:  The Air Force, Colt and Eugene Stoner believed that the addition of a forward assist was an unjustified expense. As a result, the design was split into two variants: the Air Force's M16 without the forward assist, and the XM16E1 (AKA: M16A1) with the forward assist for the other service branches. In November 1963, McNamara approved the U.S. Army's order of 85,000 XM16E1s; and to appease General LeMay, the Air Force was granted an order for another 19,000 M16s. In March 1964, the M16 rifle went into production and the Army accepted delivery of the first batch of 2129 rifles later that year, and an additional 57,240 rifles the following year.\n[5] Title: \"ArmaLite AR-15\" Text:  ArmaLite AR-15 The ArmaLite AR-15 is a select-fire, air-cooled, gas-operated, magazine-fed assault rifle manufactured in the United States between 1959 and 1964, and adopted by the United States Armed Forces as the M16 rifle. Designed by American gun manufacturer ArmaLite in 1956, it was based on its AR-10 rifle. The ArmaLite AR-15 was designed to be a lightweight assault rifle and to fire a new high-velocity, lightweight, small-caliber cartridge to allow infantrymen to carry more ammunition. In 1959, ArmaLite sold its rights to the AR-10 and AR-15 to Colt due to financial difficulties, and limitations in terms of manpower and production capacity.\nQuestion: when did the ar-15 first go on sale\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Roman de Brut\" Text:  Roman de Brut Roman de Brut (meaning \"\"Romance of Brut\"\") or \"\"Brut\"\" is a verse literary history of Britain by the poet Wace. It is based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"\"Historia Regum Britanniae\"\", and was probably begun around 1150 and finished in 1155. Written in the Norman language, it consists of 14,866 lines. It was intended for a Norman audience interested in the legends and history of the new territories of the Anglo-Norman realm, covering the story of King Arthur and taking the history of Britain all the way back to the mythical Brutus of Troy.\n[2] Title: \"Layamon's Brut\" Text:  Layamon's Brut Layamon's \"\"Brut (ca. 1190 - 1215), also known as The Chronicle of Britain\"\", is a Middle English poem compiled and recast by the English priest Layamon. The \"\"Brut\"\" is 16,096 lines long and narrates the history of Britain: it is the first historiography written in English since the \"\"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\"\". Named for Britain's mythical founder, Brutus of Troy, the poem is largely based on the Anglo-Norman \"\"Roman de Brut\"\" by Wace, which is in turn a version of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Latin \"\"Historia Regum Britanniae\"\".\n[3] Title: Layamon Text:  His poem had a significant impact on medieval history writing in England and the development of Arthurian literature and subsequently provided inspiration for numerous later writers, including Sir Thomas Malory and Jorge Luis Borges. \"\"Brut\"\" (ca. 1190) is a Middle English poem compiled and recast by the English priest Layamon. It is named after Britain's mythical founder, Brutus of Troy. It is contained in the MSS. Cotton Caligula A.ix, written in the first quarter of the 13th century, and in the Cotton Otho C.xiii, written about fifty years later (though in this edition it is shorter).\n[4] Title: Layamon Text:  Layamon Layamon or Laghamon (, ; ) \u2013 spelled La\u021damon or La\u021damonn in his time, occasionally written Lawman \u2013 was a poet of the late 12th/early 13th century and author of the \"\"Brut\"\", a notable work that was the first to present the legends of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in English poetry. J. R. R. Tolkien valued him as a transmitter of early English legends in a fashion comparable to the role played with respect to Icelandic legend by Snorri Sturluson. Layamon describes himself in his poem as a priest, living at Areley Kings in Worcestershire.\n[5] Title: \"English poetry\" Text:  While Anglo-Norman or Latin was preferred for high culture, English literature by no means died out, and a number of important works illustrate the development of the language. Around the turn of the 13th century, Layamon wrote his \"\"Brut\"\", based on Wace's 12th century Anglo-Norman epic of the same name; Layamon's language is recognisably Middle English, though his prosody shows a strong Anglo-Saxon influence remaining. Other transitional works were preserved as popular entertainment, including a variety of romances and lyrics. With time, the English language regained prestige, and in 1362 it replaced French and Latin in Parliament and courts of law.\nQuestion: who wrote brut and what is the poem about\nYour answer: ",

It was repealed by the Magnuson Act on December 17, 1943, which allowed 105 Chinese to enter per year. Chinese immigration later increased with the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which abolished direct racial barriers, and later by Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which abolished the National Origins Formula. The first significant Chinese immigration to North America began with the California Gold Rush of 1848\u20131855 and it continued with subsequent large labor projects, such as the building of the First Transcontinental Railroad.\n[2] Title: \"Chinese Exclusion Act\" Text:  The Act was renewed for ten years by the 1892 Geary Act, and again with no terminal date in 1902. When the act was extended in 1902, it required \"\"each Chinese resident to register and obtain a certificate of residence. Without a certificate, he or she faced deportation.\"\" Between 1882 and 1905, about 10,000 Chinese appealed against negative immigration decisions to federal court, usually via a petition for habeas corpus. In most of these cases, the courts ruled in favor of the petitioner. Except in cases of bias or negligence, these petitions were barred by an act that passed Congress in 1894 and was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"\"U.S.\"\" vs \"\"Lem Moon Sing\"\" (1895).\n[3] Title: \"Chinese Americans\" Text:  The Chinese Government considered this act a direct insult, but was unable to prevent its passage. In 1892, Congress voted to renew exclusion for ten years in the Geary Act, and in 1902, the prohibition was expanded to cover Hawaii and the Philippines, all over strong objections from the Chinese Government and people. Congress later extended the Exclusion Act indefinitely. The initial immigration group may have been as high as 90% male due to the Chinese Exclusion act, resulting in most immigrants coming with the thought of earning money, and then returning to China to start a family.\n[4] Title: \"History of Chinese Americans\" Text:  Renewed in 1892 and extended indefinitely in 1902, the Chinese population declined until the act was repealed in 1943 by the Magnuson Act. Official discrimination extended to the highest levels of the U.S. government: in 1888, U.S. President Grover Cleveland, who supported the Chinese Exclusion Act, proclaimed the Chinese \"\"an element ignorant of our constitution and laws, impossible of assimilation with our people and dangerous to our peace and welfare.\"\" Many Western states also enacted discriminatory laws that made it difficult for Chinese and Japanese immigrants to own land and find work.\n[5] Title: \"China\u2013United States relations\" Text:  In the first significant restriction on free immigration in U.S. history, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act on May 6, 1882, following revisions made in 1880 to the Burlingame Treaty. Those revisions allowed the United States to suspend immigration, and Congress acted quickly to implement the suspension of Chinese immigration and exclude Chinese skilled and unskilled laborers from entering the country for ten years, under penalty of imprisonment and deportation. The ban was renewed a number of times, lasting for over 60 years. The American China Development Company, founded in 1895 by industrialists J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie, sought to provide the American capital and management that would generate a rapid industrialization of China.\nQuestion: when was the chinese exclusion act made permanent\nYour answer: ",

The first stable line-up consisted of Quittenton, White, Martin Pugh (guitar), Steve Davy (bass), and Michael Rushton (drums).\n[3] Title: Mandolin Text:  The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs. \"\"Maggie May\"\" by Rod Stewart, which hit No. 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100, also featured Jackson's playing. It has also been used by other British rock musicians. Led Zeppelin's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including \"\"Going to California\"\" and \"\"That's the Way\"\"; the mandolin part on \"\"The Battle of Evermore\"\" is played by Jimmy Page, who composed the song.\n[4] Title: \"Maggie May\" Text:  The cymbal crashes had to be overdubbed separately some days later. The song was released as the B-side of the single \"\"Reason to Believe\"\", but soon radio stations began playing the B-side and \"\"Maggie May\"\" became the more popular side. The song was Stewart's first substantial hit as a solo performer and launched his solo career. It remains one of his best-known songs. A live performance of the song on \"\"Top of the Pops\"\" saw the Faces joined onstage by DJ John Peel, who pretended to play the mandolin (the mandolin player on the recording was Ray Jackson of Lindisfarne).\n[5] Title: \"Rod Stewart\" Text:  His payment was a set of seat covers for his car.

Originally published in Bengali script, it evolved into an English format published from Kolkata and other locations such as Cuttack, Ranchi and Allahabad. The paper discontinued its publication in 1991 after 123 years of publication, although it was relaunched in Dhaka in 2006 where it is now published in Bengali once again. It debuted on 20 February 1868. It was started by Sisir Ghosh and Moti Lal Ghosh, sons of Hari Naryan Ghosh, a rich merchant from Magura, in Jessore District during the Bengal Presidency of the British Raj (present day in Bangladesh).\n[2] Title: \"Amrita Bazar Patrika\" Text:  In 1920, Russian Communist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin described \"\"ABP\"\" as the best nationalist paper in India. \"\"ABP\"\" was born as a Bengali weekly in February 1868 in the village of Amrita Bazaar in Jessore district (now located in modern-day Bangladesh). It was started by the Ghosh brothers to fight the cause of peasants who were being exploited by indigo planters. Sisir Kumar Ghosh was the first editor. The \"\"Patrika\"\" operated out of a battered wooden press purchased for Rs 32.\n[3] Title: \"Amrita Bazar Patrika\" Text:  In 1871, the \"\"Patrika\"\" moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata), due to the outbreak of plague in Amrita Bazaar. Here it functioned as a bilingual weekly, publishing news and views in English and Bengali. Its anti-government views and vast influence among the people was a thorn in the flesh of the government. Lord Lytton, the Viceroy of India promulgated the Vernacular Press Act on 1878 mainly against ABP. The \"\"Patrika\"\" became a daily in 1891. It was the first Indian-owned English daily to go into investigative journalism.\n[4] Title: \"Amrita Bazar Patrika\" Text:  The family had constructed a Bazaar and named it after Amritamoyee, wife of Hari Naryan Ghosh.

It had built its readership as a rival to \"\"Bengalee\"\" which was being looked after by Surendranath Banerjee. \"\"Amrita Bazaar Patrika\"\" was the oldest Indian-owned English daily.

When Jeffrey Tambor signed for his voice cameo, he saw his character (King Neptune) and joked, \"\"This is me.\"\" He remembered the first cartoon he saw, \"\"Bambi\"\": \"\"My first cartoon, I had to be carried out crying [...] It was \"\"Bambi\"\".\n[2] Title: \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" Text:  The film features guest appearances by Jeffrey Tambor as King Neptune, Scarlett Johansson as the King's daughter Mindy, Alec Baldwin as Dennis, and David Hasselhoff as himself.

This lack of a stable source of funding had made it difficult for the Continental Army both to obtain its necessary provisions and to pay its soldiers. During the war, and for some time after, Congress obtained what funds it could from subsidies from the King of France, from aid requested from the several states (which were often unable or unwilling to contribute), and from European loans. An amendment to the Articles had been proposed by Thomas Burke, in February 1781, to give Congress the power to collect a 5% impost, or duty on all imports, but this required ratification by all states; securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782.\n[2] Title: \"Financial cost of the Iraq War\" Text:  The military states that the yearly refurbishment cost has increased by a factor of ten compared to that of the pre-war state. As of December 2006 approximately 500 M1 tanks, 700 Bradley Fighting Vehicles and 1000 Humvees are awaiting repair in US military depots. In September 2007, the Congressional Budget Office produced a report outlining the Army's Reset Program and included some combat loss numbers. As of March 2006, approximately \u00a34.5 billion ($6.8 billion) had been spent by the United Kingdom in Iraq. All of this money has come from a government fund called the \"\"Special Reserve\"\" which at the time had an allocation of \u00a37.4 billion ($ billion).\n[3] Title: \"Zimbabwe National Army\" Text:  Over half the army's tanks and armoured vehicles were rendered unserviceable due to a lack of funds to source spare parts, fuel, or training ammunition. To raise funds, the ZNA was forced to auction off much of its trailers, ammunition trucks, and engineering vehicles. Army ammunition continued to be sourced from ZDI, but the latter suspended operations in 2015 when the ZNA defaulted on its payments. In February 2017, Zimbabwean officials revealed that the army and air force were heavily in debt with Chinese creditors due to defaulting on payments for Chinese arms.\n[4] Title: \"Charles Townshend (British Army officer)\" Text:  Most of the revenue used to fund the Army of India came from selling opium to China, and the end of opium sales to China in 1910 had cost the Indian government about \u00a34 million (about \u00a350 million in 1984 values) without any replacement. For Lord Hardinge, having to operate on reduced means and whose mandate dictated that securing the North-West Frontier was his primary responsibility, the demand to send troops to Europe was unwelcome, and he fought hard to keep the Army of India in India. Failing that, Hardinge wanted the Persian Gulf to be the exclusive responsibility for the Raj, since this was considered a quiet theatre that would not drain away too many troops and by having the Raj protect Britain's oil supplies, allowing him to say that India was making a major contribution to the war effort.\n[5] Title: \"British Indian Army\" Text:  The Indian Army has its origins in the years after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, often called the Indian Mutiny in British histories, when in 1858 the Crown took over direct rule of British India from the East India Company. Before 1858, the precursor units of the Indian Army were units controlled by the Company and were paid for by their profits. These operated alongside units of the British Army, funded by the British government in London. The armies of the East India Company were recruited primarily from Muslims in the Bengal Presidency, which consisted of Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and high caste Hindus recruited primarily from the rural plains of Oudh.\nQuestion: where does the army get its money from\nYour answer: ",

Russia was selected to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup, making it the first time that the World Cup will be hosted in Eastern Europe and making it the biggest country geographically to host the World Cup. Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, making it the first time a World Cup will be held in the Arab World and the second time in Asia since the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan. Also, the decision made it the smallest country geographically to host the World Cup.\n[2] Title: \"FIFA World Cup\" Text:  However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018. This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder. The 2026 FIFA World Cup was chosen to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico, marking the first time a World Cup has been shared by three host nations. The 2026 tournament will be the biggest World Cup ever held, with 48 teams playing 80 matches.\n[3] Title: \"FIFA World Cup\" Text:  Qatar are planned as hosts of the 2022 finals, and 2026 will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States and Mexico, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to have hosted games in three finals. The world's first international football match was a challenge match played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England, which ended in a 0\u20130 draw. The first international tournament, the inaugural British Home Championship, took place in 1884. As football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the start of the 20th century, it was held as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics (however, the IOC has retroactively upgraded their status to official events), and at the 1906 Intercalated Games.\n[4] Title: \"Jack Warner (football executive)\" Text:  Furthermore, Warner proposed that, if the World Cup were to be held in Europe, it should be held in Italy, Spain or France (countries that last hosted the competition in 1990, 1982 and 1998 respectively). He said that he would \"\"battle to bring...the tournament to his region\"\" However, on 14 February 2008, Warner retracted this stance.

The show was expanded into an hour-long format on November 3, 1975, allowing six pricing games to be played per episode. A new feature, the Showcase Showdown, was added to select which players would play in the Showcase. It is played after the first three players have completed their pricing games to select one player from this set, and again after the last three. In the Showdown, each player is given two chances to spin a wheel which displays every monetary amount from 5\u00a2 to $1.00 in 5\u00a2 increments.\n[2] Title: \"The Price Is Right (UK game show)\" Text:  When it started in 1995, Bruce's Price is Right was one of the first shows to fully take advantage of the Independent Television Commission's lifting of the prize limits and the general deregulation of the UK broadcasting environment. The Showcase Showdown was played on the Big Wheel (objections to lack of skill no longer being a factor), with the highest-scoring contestant on one spin or a combination of two spins going through to the Range Finder, and any contestant who scored 100 on one spin or a combination of two spins would win \u00a31,000.\n[3] Title: \"The New Price Is Right (1994 game show)\" Text:  When tapings for the series began, the production staff was forced to alter its plans for the Showcase Showdown slightly. The original plan was for The Price Was Right to be the only game played to determine the Showcase participant, but the staff had not been able to find enough vintage commercials and product prices to use. Thus, some early episodes featured the traditional Showcase Showdown where the contestants spun The Big Wheel. The contestants spun in order from highest to lowest winnings, as opposed to the daytime series which did the opposite, and the object remained to get as close to one dollar without going over.\n[4] Title: \"The New Price Is Right (1994 game show)\" Text:  However, lending to the overall theme of change that was present throughout the series, the production staff of \"\"The New Price Is Right\"\" conducted their Showcase Showdown in a much different manner. The most frequently featured Showcase Showdown game was called \"\"The Price \"\"Was\"\" Right\"\", a modification of the One Bid featured on the daytime show. The three contestants stood behind three lecterns at the foot of the stage (a modified Contestants' Row). Davidson introduced a vintage television commercial and provided the year the commercial aired.\n[5] Title: \"The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)\" Text:  Eight years after the cancellation of Kennedy's \"\"Price Is Right,\"\" a new syndicated version premiered on September 12, 1994, hosted by Doug Davidson and distributed by Paramount Domestic Television. This series featured several significant changes: eliminating Contestants' Row, a different format for the Showcase Showdown, a Showcase featuring only one contestant, a completely different set and a much larger budget (even when compared to the two previous syndicated runs) that gave contestants the potential to win up to five times what they could win on the daytime show.\nQuestion: when did the showcase showdown start on the price is right\nYour answer: ",

Estrada's impeachment trial ended prematurely, while Gutierrez and Bautista resigned before the Senate convened as an impeachment court. Sereno' Based on Article XI, Section 2 of the Constitution The following officials may be subjected to impeachment: Other officials can be removed from offices but not by impeachment: those under the executive department may be dismissed by the president; members of Congress can be expelled by two-thirds vote of the chamber the member is a part of; local elected officials can be removed from office through recall.\n[2] Title: \"United States district court\" Text:  The sole method of involuntary removal of a judge is through impeachment by the United States House of Representatives followed by a trial in the United States Senate and a conviction by a two-thirds vote. Otherwise, a judge, even if convicted of a felony criminal offense by a jury, is entitled to hold office until retirement or death. In the history of the United States, only twelve judges have been impeached by the House, and only seven have been removed following conviction in the Senate. (For a table that includes the twelve impeached judges, see Impeachment in the United States.)\n[3] Title: \"Bowsher v. Synar\" Text:  Once Congress passes legislation, it can influence only its execution by passing new laws or through impeachment. The Constitution provides Congress the power to remove executive officers only by impeachment. Also, the Constitutional Convention explicitly rejected language that would have permitted impeachment for \"\"maladministration,\"\" with Madison arguing that \"\"so vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate\"\". Thus, Congress can remove a member of the executive branch only through impeachment. Justice White's dissent argued that the act should have been upheld.\n[4] Title: Presidency Text:  In the United States, the impeachment process begins in the House of Representatives, where the president is first accused of committing either bribery, treason, or other high crimes including misdemeanors. If the House passes a majority vote to impeach the president, the Senate then conducts the trial to remove them from office. If a president is found guilty, he is removed from office and replaced by the vice president for the remainder of the term. If the president is acquitted in court, he will continue to serve the rest of their term as president.\n[5] Title: \"Article One of the United States Constitution\" Text:  The specification that a two-thirds super-majority vote of those Senators present in order to convict was also thought necessary to facilitate serious deliberation and to make removal possible only through a consensus that cuts across factional divisions. If any officer is convicted on impeachment, he or she is immediately removed from office, and may be barred from holding any public office in the future. No other punishments may be inflicted pursuant to the impeachment proceeding, but the convicted party remains liable to trial and punishment in the courts for civil and criminal charges.

The amendment was officially submitted to the states on December 12, 1803, and was ratified by the legislatures of the following states: The amendment was rejected by Delaware, on January 18, 1804, and by Connecticut, on May 10, 1804.

This amendment was adopted on December 15, 1791, along with the rest of the United States Bill of Rights. The phrases in this amendment originated in the English Bill of Rights of 1689.

It is almost identical to a provision in the English Bill of Rights of 1689, in which Parliament declared, \"\"as their ancestors in like cases have usually done...that excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\"\" The provision was largely inspired by the case in England of Titus Oates who, after the ascension of King James II in 1685, was tried for multiple acts of perjury that had led to executions of many people Oates had wrongly accused.\n[5] Title: \"Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution\" Text:  England's declaration against \"\"cruel and unusual punishments\"\" was approved by Parliament in February 1689, and was read to King William III and his wife Queen Mary II on the following day. Members of Parliament then explained in August 1689 that \"\"the Commons had a particular regard\u2026when that Declaration was first made\"\" to punishments like the one that had been inflicted by the King's Bench against Titus Oates. Parliament then enacted the English Bill of Rights into law in December 1689. Members of parliament characterized the punishment in the Oates case as not just \"\"barbarous\"\" and \"\"inhuman\"\" but also \"\"extravagant\"\" and \"\"exorbitant\"\".\nQuestion: when was the 8th amendment passed and ratified\nYour answer: ",

Northwest of Langar is the high Karl Marx Peak and Friedrich Engels Peak (). A road runs along the river on the Tajik side to Khargush where it turns north to join the Pamir Highway. A road of lower quality continues east past Zorkul, almost to the Chinese border. John Wood was the first known European to try to find the source of the Oxus, or Pamir River. He made a pioneering journey in 1839 and reached Lake Zorkul.\n[2] Title: Zorkul Text:  Out of the lake, towards the west, flows the Pamir River, tracing the Afghan-Tajik border. It is therefore a source of the Amu Darya or Oxus River. The Great Pamir extends to the south of the lake. The lake is on the path of the Silk Road. It was referred to as \"\"Great Dragon Pool\"\" () in Chinese historical records. The lake was once in the territory of the mir of Wakhan, but the lake and river were established as the border between Russia and Afghanistan by agreement between the Russians and the British in 1895.\n[3] Title: Zorkul Text:  Zorkul Zorkul (or \"\"Sir-i-kol, Syr Kul, Kol-ye Zor Kol,K\u014dl-ye Zor K\u014dl,Lake Victoria,Ozero Zorkul',Ozero Zorkul\u2019,Sar-i-Kol,Sar-i-Kul...\"\") is a lake in the Pamir Mountains that runs along the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan. It extends east to west for about 25 km. The Afghan-Tajik border runs along the lake from east to west, turning south towards Concord Peak (5,469 m), about 15 km south of the lake. The lake's northern half lies in Tajikistan where it is protected as part of the Zorkul Nature Reserve.\n[4] Title: \"The Great Game\" Text:  The report of the Commission proved the absolute impracticality of any Russian invasion of India through the Pamir mountains. The result was that Afghanistan became a buffer state between the two powers. It was agreed that the Amu Darya river would form the border between Afghanistan and the Russian empire. Russia gained full possession of all of the Pamir Mountains, except for Taghdumbash, which would be the subject of a later Afghan-China agreement. To conclude their agreement, one peak was named Mount Concord. In exchange for a British agreement to use the term \"\"Nicholas Range\"\" in honor of the Emperor Nicholas II of Russia on official maps, the Russians agreed to refer to Lake Zorkul as \"\"Lake Victoria\"\" in honor of Queen Victoria of England.\n[5] Title: \"The Great Game\" Text:  This left the border east of Lake Zorkul in the Wakhan region to be defined. This territory was claimed by China, Russia and Afghanistan. In the 1880s, the Afghans had advanced north of the lake to the Alichur Pamir. In 1891, Russia sent a military force to this area and its commander, Yanov, ordered the British Captain Francis Younghusband to leave Bozai Gumbaz in the Little Pamir. The Russians claimed that because they had annexed the Khanate of Kokand they had a claim over the Pamirs.

After General George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River north of Trenton the previous night, Washington led the main body of the Continental Army against Hessian mercenaries garrisoned at Trenton.

Following the victory at the Battle of Trenton early in the morning of December 26, 1776, General George Washington of the Continental Army and his council of war expected a strong British counter-attack. Washington and the council decided to meet this attack in Trenton, and established a defensive position south of the Assunpink Creek.\n[3] Title: \"American Revolutionary War\" Text:  On December 25, 1776, Washington stealthily crossed the Delaware River, and his army overwhelmed the Hessian garrison at Trenton, New Jersey the following morning, taking 900 prisoners.

The Hessians captured in the Battle of Trenton were paraded through the streets of Philadelphia to raise American morale; anger at their presence helped the Continental Army recruit new soldiers. Most of the prisoners were sent to work as farm hands.\n[5] Title: \"Battle of the Assunpink Creek\" Text:  That defeat prompted the British to withdraw from most of New Jersey for the winter.

In May 1990, the government held free elections for the first time in almost 30 years and the National League for Democracy (NLD), the party of Aung San Suu Kyi, won 392 out of a total 492 seats (i.e., 80% of the seats). However, the military junta refused to cede power and continued to rule the nation as SLORC until 1997, and then as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) until its dissolution in March 2011.\n[2] Title: \"History of Myanmar\" Text:  The military government announced a change of name for the country in English from \"\"Burma\"\" to \"\"Myanmar\"\" in 1989. It also continued the economic reforms started by the old regime and called for a Constituent Assembly to revise the 1974 Constitution. This led to multiparty elections in May 1990 in which the National League for Democracy (NLD) won a landslide victory over the National Unity Party (NUP, the successor to the BSPP) and about a dozen smaller parties.

The official English name was changed by the country's government from the \"\"Union of Burma\"\" to the \"\"Union of Myanmar\"\" in 1989, and still later to the \"\"Republic of the Union of Myanmar\"\", which since then has been the subject of controversies and mixed incidences of adoption.\n[4] Title: Myanmar Text:  The terms are also popularly thought to derive from \"\"Brahma Desha\"\" after Brahma. In 1989, the military government officially changed the English translations of many names dating back to Burma's colonial period or earlier, including that of the country itself: \"\"Burma\"\" became \"\"Myanmar\"\". The renaming remains a contested issue. Many political and ethnic opposition groups and countries continue to use \"\"Burma\"\" because they do not recognise the legitimacy of the ruling military government or its authority to rename the country.\n[5] Title: \"Names of Myanmar\" Text:  Thus, for instance, Rangoon was changed to Yangon to reflect the fact that the \"\"r\"\" sound is no longer used in Standard Burmese and merged with a \"\"y\"\" glide. As for the country's name, the commission decided to replace the English name \"\"Burma\"\" with \"\"Myanmar\"\", for three reasons. First, \"\"Myanma\"\" is the official name of the country in the Burmese language, and the aim of the commission was to have English place names aligned with Burmese place names and pronunciation.\nQuestion: when was the name burma changed to myanmar\nYour answer: ",

Spanish priests named them as the people colonized by the nearby Mission San Juan Capistrano. Today many contemporary Juane\u00f1o who identify as descendants of the indigenous society living in the local San Juan and San Mateo Creek drainage areas prefer the adopted indigenous term \"\"Acjachemen\"\" as their autonym, or name for themselves, in an effort to decolonize their history. The Acjachemen territory extends from Las Pulgas Creek in northern San Diego County up into the San Joaquin Hills along Orange County's central coast, and inland from the Pacific Ocean up into the Santa Ana Mountains.\n[5] Title: \"Mission San Juan Capistrano\" Text:  The highest concentration of villages was along the lower San Juan, where Mission San Juan Capistrano was ultimately situated and is preserved today. The \"\"Acjachemen\"\" resided in permanent, well-defined villages and seasonal camps. Village populations ranged from between 35 and 300 inhabitants, consisting of a single lineage in the smaller villages, and of a dominant clan joined with other families in the larger settlements. Each clan had its own resource territory and was \"\"politically\"\" independent; ties to other villages were maintained through economic, religious, and social networks in the immediate region.\nQuestion: what native american tribe lived at san juan capistrano\nYour answer: ",

A second, more deadly attack near the conclusion of \"\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\"\" resulted in over 50 deaths, including Voldemort, who died when the Killing Curse he threw at Harry rebounded on him. Voldemort's death signalled the end of the Death Eaters. Voldemort's Death Eaters practise illegal and dangerous spells known as dark magic.\n[2] Title: \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)\" Text:  Snape arrives, and casts the killing curse on Dumbledore when Draco is unable to bring himself to do it, killing the Headmaster. He then overpowers Harry and reveals himself as the Half-Blood Prince before escaping. Harry returns to Hogwarts, where the students, staff, and a few guests mourn Dumbledore's death.

The locket contains a message from \"\"R.A.B. \"\", stating that he has stolen the real Horcrux with the intent of destroying it.\n[3] Title: \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" Text:  Dumbledore freezes Harry under his Invisibility Cloak with a body-bind spell, to keep him hidden. Draco disarms Dumbledore of his wand and then threatens to kill him, which turns out to have been his mission from Voldemort all along. Draco is unable to go through with it and when Snape arrives, he casts the spell to kill Dumbledore instead. Harry ignores the battle raging in Hogwarts to pursue Dumbledore's killer. Snape successfully fights Harry off, and he reveals that he is in fact the Half-Blood Prince before he, Draco, and the rest of the Death Eaters escape.\n[4] Title: \"Harry Potter (character)\" Text:  Two Horcruxes have been destroyed\u2014the diary and a ring; and Harry and Dumbledore locate another, although it is a fake.

The Constitutional Convention took place during the summer of 1787, in Philadelphia. Although the Convention was called to revise the Articles of Confederation, the intention from the outset for some including James Madison and Alexander Hamilton was to create a new frame of government rather than amending the existing one. The delegates elected George Washington to preside over the Convention. The result of the Convention was the United States Constitution and the replacement of the Continental Congress with the United States Congress.\n[2] Title: \"Articles of Confederation\" Text:  However, as more states became interested in meeting to change the Articles, a meeting was set in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787. This became the Constitutional Convention. It was quickly realized that changes would not work, and instead the entire Articles needed to be replaced. On March 4, 1789, the government under the Articles was replaced with the federal government under the Constitution. The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive (the President), courts, and taxing powers. The political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the Albany Congress in 1754 and Benjamin Franklin's proposed Albany Plan, an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems.\n[3] Title: Pennsylvania Text:  When the Founding Fathers of the United States convened in Philadelphia in 1774, 12 colonies sent representatives to the First Continental Congress. The Second Continental Congress, which also met in Philadelphia (in May 1775), drew up and signed the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia, but when that city was captured by the British, the Continental Congress escaped westward, meeting at the Lancaster courthouse on Saturday, September 27, 1777, and then to York. There they and its primary author, John Dickinson, drew up the Articles of Confederation that formed 13 independent colonies into a new nation.\n[4] Title: \"History of the United States (1776\u20131789)\" Text:  The Battle of Lexington and Concord ignited the American Revolutionary War. As news spread, local shadow governments (called \"\"committees of correspondence\"\") in each of the 13 colonies drove out royal officials and sent militiamen to Boston to besiege the British there. The Second Continental Congress met in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the aftermath of armed clashes in April. With all thirteen colonies represented, it immediately began to organize itself as a central government with control over the diplomacy and instructed the colonies to write constitutions for themselves as states.\n[5] Title: \"Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776\" Text:  For example in June 1774, after Governor Penn refused to convene the Assembly to consider the question of discussing some action to the British government\u2019s response to the Boston Tea Party, a public meeting held, under the leadership of John Dickinson and Thomas Willing, attracted 8,000 in Philadelphia to call for the First Continental Congress and establish a committee of correspondence to communicate with the other colonies. Although these measures were subsequently adopted by the Assembly, other public action committees supported by large public demonstrations (in the thousands) outpaced Assembly action, including the establishment of a military association for defense (again validated by the Assembly later as the Committee of Safety).\nQuestion: where and when did the colonists meet to write the constitution\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" Text:  While My Guitar Gently Weeps \"\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\"\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 double album \"\"The Beatles\"\" (also known as \"\"the White Album\"\"). It was written by George Harrison, the band's lead guitarist. The song serves as a comment on the disharmony within the Beatles following their return from studying Transcendental Meditation in India in early 1968. This lack of camaraderie was reflected in the band's initial apathy towards the composition, which Harrison countered by inviting his friend and occasional collaborator, Eric Clapton, to contribute to the recording.\n[2] Title: \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" Text:  Clapton overdubbed a lead guitar part, although he was not formally credited for his contribution. Harrison wrote \"\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\"\" as an exercise in randomness inspired by the Chinese \"\"I Ching\"\". The song conveys his dismay at the world's unrealised potential for universal love, which he refers to as \"\"the love there that's sleeping\"\". Harrison first recorded it with a sparse backing of acoustic guitar and harmonium \u2013 a version that appeared on the 1996 \"\"Anthology 3\"\" outtakes compilation and, with the addition of a string arrangement by George Martin, on the \"\"Love\"\" soundtrack album in 2006.\n[3] Title: \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" Text:  In his lyrics to \"\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\"\", Harrison revisits the theme of universal love and the philosophical concerns that were evident in his overtly Indian-influenced compositions, particularly \"\"Within You Without You\"\". The song is a lament for how a universal love for humankind is latent in all individuals yet remains unrealised. In the description of theologian Dale Allison, the song \"\"conveys spiritual angst and an urgent religious point of view without being explicitly theological\"\". Harrison sings of surveying \"\"you all\"\" and seeing \"\"the love there that's sleeping\"\".\n[4] Title: \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" Text:  According to Harrison biographer Joshua Greene, the song's message reflects the pessimism encouraged by world events throughout 1968, such as the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy in the United States, and the Soviet Russian oppression of Czechoslovakia. Allison writes that the lyrics represent the \"\"antithesis of spiritual triumphalism\"\", in which Harrison \"\"mourns because love has not conquered all\"\". The Beatles recorded \"\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\"\" several times during the sessions for their self-titled double album, also known as \"\"the White Album\"\".\n[5] Title: \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" Text:  Embracing this idea of relativism, he committed to writing a song based on the first words he saw upon opening a book, which happened to be \"\"gently weeps\"\". Harrison continued to work on the lyrics after this initial writing session. The song reflects the disharmonious atmosphere within the Beatles following their return from India. Harrison had led the band in their highly publicised endorsement of Transcendental Meditation and viewed this spiritual pursuit as superior in importance to their career momentum. When discussing another song he wrote at this time, \"\"Not Guilty\"\", Harrison said it referred to \"\"the grief I was catching\"\" from John Lennon and Paul McCartney for leading them to Rishikesh and supposedly hindering the group's career and the launch of their Apple record label.\nQuestion: who wrote while my guitar gently weeps lyrics\nYour answer: ",

Correlations may be positive (rising), negative (falling), or null (uncorrelated). If the pattern of dots slopes from lower left to upper right, it indicates a positive correlation between the variables being studied. If the pattern of dots slopes from upper left to lower right, it indicates a negative correlation. A line of best fit (alternatively called 'trendline') can be drawn in order to study the relationship between the variables.\n[2] Title: \"Scatter plot\" Text:  An equation for the correlation between the variables can be determined by established best-fit procedures. For a linear correlation, the best-fit procedure is known as linear regression and is guaranteed to generate a correct solution in a finite time. No universal best-fit procedure is guaranteed to generate a correct solution for arbitrary relationships. A scatter plot is also very useful when we wish to see how two comparable data sets agree to show nonlinear relationships between variables. The ability to do this can be enhanced by adding a smooth line such as LOESS. Furthermore, if the data are represented by a mixture model of simple relationships, these relationships will be visually evident as superimposed patterns.\n[3] Title: \"Ordinary least squares\" Text:  When only one dependent variable is being modeled, a scatterplot will suggest the form and strength of the relationship between the dependent variable and regressors. It might also reveal outliers, heteroscedasticity, and other aspects of the data that may complicate the interpretation of a fitted regression model. The scatterplot suggests that the relationship is strong and can be approximated as a quadratic function. OLS can handle non-linear relationships by introducing the regressor HEIGHT. The regression model then becomes a multiple linear model: The output from most popular statistical packages will look similar to this: In this table: Ordinary least squares analysis often includes the use of diagnostic plots designed to detect departures of the data from the assumed form of the model.\n[4] Title: \"Scatter plot\" Text:  If a parameter exists that is systematically incremented and/or decremented by the other, it is called the \"\"control parameter\"\" or independent variable and is customarily plotted along the horizontal axis. The measured or dependent variable is customarily plotted along the vertical axis. If no dependent variable exists, either type of variable can be plotted on either axis and a scatter plot will illustrate only the degree of correlation (not causation) between two variables.

Since 2000 there have been 15 fatal shark attacks along the West Australian coast with divers now facing odds of one in 16,000 for a fatal shark bite. Other shark attack hotspots include R\u00e9union Island, Boa Viagem in Brazil, Makena Beach, Maui, Hawaii and Second Beach, Port St. Johns, South Africa.\n[2] Title: \"Shark attack\" Text:  This is much higher than the worldwide shark attack fatality rate, which is currently about 16%, according to Florida State Museum of Natural History. The location with the most recorded shark attacks is New Smyrna Beach, Florida. Developed nations such as the United States, Australia and, to some extent, South Africa, facilitate more thorough documentation of shark attacks on humans than developing coastal nations. The increased use of technology has enabled Australia and the United States to record more data than other nations, which could somewhat bias the results recorded.\n[3] Title: \"Shark attack\" Text:  Of these attacks, the majority occurred in the United States (53 in 2000, 40 in 2005, and 39 in 2006). \"\"The New York Times\"\" reported in July 2008 that there had been only one fatal attack in the previous year. On average, there are 16 shark attacks per year in the United States, with one fatality every two years.

He was one of the first management consultants. Taylor was one of the intellectual leaders of the Efficiency Movement and his ideas, broadly conceived, were highly influential in the Progressive Era (1890s-1920s). Taylor summed up his efficiency techniques in his 1911 book \"\"The Principles of Scientific Management\"\" which, in 2001, Fellows of the Academy of Management voted the most influential management book of the twentieth century.\n[2] Title: \"Quality management\" Text:  The aim was to produce large numbers of the same goods. The first proponent in the US for this approach was Eli Whitney who proposed (interchangeable) parts manufacture for muskets, hence producing the identical components and creating a musket assembly line. The next step forward was promoted by several people including Frederick Winslow Taylor, a mechanical engineer who sought to improve industrial efficiency. He is sometimes called \"\"the father of scientific management.\"\" He was one of the intellectual leaders of the Efficiency Movement and part of his approach laid a further foundation for quality management, including aspects like standardization and adopting improved practices.\n[3] Title: \"Organizational behavior\" Text:  One of the first management consultants, Frederick Taylor, was a 19th-century engineer who applied an approach known as the scientific management. Taylor advocated for maximizing task efficiency through the scientific method. The scientific method was further refined by Lillian and Frank Gilbreth, who utilized time and motion study to further improve worker efficiency. In the early 20th century the idea of Fordism emerged. Named after automobile mogul Henry Ford, the method relied on the standardization of production through the use of assembly lines. This allowed unskilled workers to produce complex products efficiently.\n[4] Title: \"Frederick Winslow Taylor\" Text:  Taylor eventually became a professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. In early spring of 1915 Taylor caught pneumonia and died, one day after his fifty-ninth birthday, on March 21, 1915. He was buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Taylor was a mechanical engineer who sought to improve industrial efficiency. Taylor is regarded as the father of scientific management, and was one of the first management consultants and director of a famous firm. In Peter Drucker's description, Taylor's scientific management consisted of four principles: Future US Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis coined the term \"\"scientific management\"\" in the course of his argument for the Eastern Rate Case before the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1910.\n[5] Title: \"Frederick Winslow Taylor\" Text:  Taylor was an accomplished tennis and golf player.

The speech called for an Anglo-American alliance against the Soviets, whom he accused of establishing an \"\"iron curtain\"\" dividing Europe from \"\"Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic\"\". A week later, on March 13, Stalin responded vigorously to the speech, saying that Churchill could be compared to Hitler insofar as he advocated the racial superiority of English-speaking nations so that they could satisfy their hunger for world domination, and that such a declaration was \"\"a call for war on the U.S.S.R.\"\" The Soviet leader also dismissed the accusation that the USSR was exerting increasing control over the countries lying in its sphere.\n[2] Title: \"First World\" Text:  In this speech, Churchill describes the division of the West and East to be so solid that it could be called an iron curtain. In 1952, the French demographer Alfred Sauvy coined the term Third World in reference to the three estates in pre-revolutionary France. The first two estates being the nobility and clergy and everybody else comprising the third estate. He compared the capitalist world (i.e., First World) to the nobility and the communist world (i.e., Second World) to the clergy. Just as the third estate comprised everybody else, Sauvy called the Third World all the countries that were not in this Cold War division, i.e., the unaligned and uninvolved states in the \"\"East-West Conflict\"\".\n[3] Title: \"Consuelo Vanderbilt\" Text:  Many believe that Churchill polished his famous Iron Curtain Speech in that house as he visited his cousin's wife on his way to Fulton, Missouri, to deliver an address at Westminster College. Consuelo Balsan published her insightful but not entirely candid autobiography, \"\"The Glitter and the Gold\"\", in 1953.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Piano Text:  Most grand pianos in the US have three pedals: the soft pedal (una corda), sostenuto, and sustain pedal (from left to right, respectively), while in Europe, the standard is two pedals: the soft pedal and the sustain pedal. Most modern upright pianos also have three pedals: soft pedal, practice pedal and sustain pedal, though older or cheaper models may lack the practice pedal. In Europe the standard for upright pianos is two pedals: the soft and the sustain pedals. The sustain pedal (or, damper pedal) is often simply called \"\"the pedal\"\", since it is the most frequently used.\n[2] Title: \"Piano pedals\" Text:  Piano pedals Piano pedals are foot-operated levers at the base of a piano that change the instrument's sound in various ways. Modern pianos usually have three pedals, from left to right, the soft pedal (or una corda), the sostenuto pedal, and the sustaining pedal (or damper pedal). Some pianos omit the sostenuto pedal, or have a middle pedal with a different purpose such as a muting function also known as silent piano. The development of the piano's pedals is an evolution that began from the very earliest days of the piano, and continued through the late 19th century.\n[3] Title: \"Piano pedals\" Text:  Piano pedals Piano pedals are foot-operated levers at the base of a piano that change the instrument's sound in various ways. Modern pianos usually have three pedals, from left to right, the soft pedal (or una corda), the sostenuto pedal, and the sustaining pedal (or\n[4] Title: \"Piano pedals\" Text:  Throughout the years, the piano had as few as one modifying stop, and as many as six or more, before finally arriving at its current configuration of three. The \"\"damper pedal\"\", \"\"sustain pedal\"\", or \"\"sustaining pedal\"\" is to the right of the other pedals, and is used more often than the other pedals. It raises all the dampers off the strings so that they keep vibrating after the player releases the key. In effect, the damper pedal makes every string on the piano a sympathetic string, creating a rich tonal quality.\n[5] Title: \"Sustain pedal\" Text:  Sustain pedal A sustain pedal or sustaining pedal (also called damper pedal, loud pedal, or open pedal) is the most commonly used pedal in a modern piano. It is typically the rightmost of two or three pedals. When pressed, the sustain pedal \"\"sustains\"\" all the damped strings on the piano by moving all the dampers away from the strings and allowing them to vibrate freely. All notes played will continue to sound until the vibration naturally ceases, or until the pedal is released. This lets the pianist sustain notes which would otherwise be out of reach, for instance in accompanying chords - and accomplish \"\"legato\"\" passages (smoothly connected notes) which would have no possible fingering otherwise.\nQuestion: what are the names of the three pedals on a piano\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Capital gains tax in Australia\" Text:  A capital gains tax (CGT) was introduced in Australia on 20 September 1985, one of a number of tax reforms by the Hawke/Keating government. The CGT applied only to assets acquired on or after that date, with gains (or losses) on assets owned on that date, called pre-CGT assets, not being subject to the CGT. In calculating the capital gain, the cost of assets held for 1 year or more was indexed by the consumer price index (CPI), which meant that the part of the gain which was due to inflation was not taxed.\n[2] Title: \"Income tax in Australia\" Text:  Capital gains tax (CGT) in Australia is part of the income tax system rather than a separate tax. Capital gains tax was introduced by the Hawke Labor Government in September 1985 and allowed for indexation of the cost base of the capital asset to the Consumer Price Index, to account for annual price inflation. Net capital gains (after concessions are applied) are included in a taxpayer's taxable income and are taxed at marginal rates. Capital gains applies to individuals, companies and any other entity which can legally own an asset.\n[3] Title: \"Taxation in Australia\" Text:  The main recommendations of the report have all been implemented and are today part of Commonwealth taxation in Australia. On 20 September 1985, Capital gains tax was introduced. The GST replaced the older wholesale sales tax in 2000. In July 2001, the Financial Institutions Duty was abolished. Between 2002 and 2005, Bank Account Debits Tax was abolished. On the 1 July 2012 the Federal government introduced a Carbon price, requiring large emitters of carbon dioxide to purchase permits, the government also introduced a Minerals Resource Rent Tax, originally called a resources 'super profits' tax in the Henry Tax Report.\n[4] Title: \"Negative gearing\" Text:  (Any excess loss could be carried forward to offset property income in later years.) That ensured that at personal level and, more importantly, at a national level, property losses would not be subsidised by income from personal exertion. In applying the formula, all previous governments thereby isolated and consequently discouraged capital speculation being subsidised from the general income tax receipts pool. In addition, a capital gains tax (CGT) was introduced in Australia on 20 September 1985. While a separate tax, it is often associated with negative gearing.\n[5] Title: \"Capital gains tax in Australia\" Text:  The disadvantage for a trader is that the 50% discount on CGT gains for assets held 1 year or more is not available. Prior to the introduction of capital gains tax in 1985, section 52 of the ITAA 1936 required taxpayers to declare (on their next return) assets they had acquired for trading. This was known as declaring oneself a share trader, but now there's no such election. Rollover provisions allow the deferral of capital gain, either by letting a new owner keep the previous owner's cost base, or by letting an owner switch to a new similar asset and keep the old cost base.\nQuestion: when was capital gains tax introduced in australia\nYour answer: ",

The new notebooks, however, only came in 15.4-inch models and the 12-inch and 17-inch PowerBooks remained available for sale at Apple stores and retailers, as well as the 15-inch model, which was sold until supplies ran out. On April 24, 2006 the 17-inch PowerBook G4 was replaced by a 17-inch MacBook Pro variant. The 12-inch PowerBook G4 remained available until May 16, 2006, when the MacBook was introduced as a replacement for the iBook. Because of its availability in highly powerful configurations, it was also considered a replacement for the 12-inch PowerBook, ending the nearly 15-year production of PowerBook-branded computers.\n[2] Title: \"MacBook Pro\" Text:  MacBook Pro The MacBook Pro (sometimes abbreviated as MBP) is a line of Macintosh portable computers introduced in January 2006 by Apple Inc. It is the high-end model of the MacBook family and is currently available in 13- and 15-inch screen sizes. A 17-inch version was available between April 2006 and June 2012. The first generation MacBook Pro is externally similar to the PowerBook G4 it replaces, but uses Intel Core processors instead of PowerPC G4 chips. The 15-inch model was introduced first, in January 2006; the 17-inch model followed in April.\n[3] Title: \"PowerBook G4\" Text:  The stalling development of the G5 is also said to be another main factor in Apple's transition from PowerPC to Intel processors. After awaiting a new professional-grade notebook to replace the G4, on January 10, 2006, Apple released the 15\"\" MacBook Pro, its first Intel-based notebook. A 17\"\" version of the MacBook Pro followed on April 24, 2006. The new \"\"MacBook Pro\"\" name was given to the new series of notebooks after Apple changed the portable naming schemes from \"\"Power\"\" for professional products (and \"\"i\"\" for consumer products), in favor of including \"\"Mac\"\" in the title of all computer lines, with the suffix \"\"Pro\"\" denoting a pro product.\n[4] Title: \"MacBook Pro\" Text:  The 17-inch model was unveiled on April 24, 2006. The first design was largely a carryover from the PowerBook G4, but uses Intel Core CPUs instead of PowerPC G4 chips. The 15-inch MacBook Pro weighs the same as the 15-inch aluminum PowerBook G4, but is deeper, wider, and thinner. Other changes from the PowerBook include a built-in iSight webcam and the inclusion of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector designed to detach easily when yanked. These features were later brought over to the MacBook. The optical drive was reduced in size in order to fit into the slimmer MacBook Pro, hence it runs slower than the optical drive in the PowerBook G4 and cannot write to dual layer DVDs.\n[5] Title: \"MacBook Pro\" Text:  On February 26, 2008, the MacBook Pro line was again updated.

Tilden, as well as aggressive newspaper editors aided by the biting cartoons of Thomas Nast, helped elect opposition candidates in 1871. Tweed was convicted of forgery and larceny in 1873. Tweed's fall put an end to the immunity of corrupt local political leaders and was a precursor to Progressive Era reforms in the city. Tammany did not take long to rebound from Tweed's fall. Reforms demanded a general housecleaning, and former county sheriff \"\"Honest John\"\" Kelly was selected as the new leader.\n[2] Title: \"History of New York City (1855\u20131897)\" Text:  Kelly was not implicated in the Tweed scandals and was a religious Catholic related by marriage to Archbishop John McCloskey. He cleared Tammany of Tweed's people and tightened the Grand Sachem's control over the hierarchy. His success at revitalizing the machine was such that in the election of 1874, the Tammany candidate, William H. Wickham, unseated the unpopular reformist incumbent, William F. Havemeyer, and Democrats generally won their races, delivering control of the city back to Tammany Hall. Theodore Roosevelt, before he became president in 1901, was deeply involved in New York City politics.\n[3] Title: \"Anson Phelps Stokes\" Text:  Stokes continued to mine at Berlin near Ione, Nevada.

In the 1870s, the cartoonist Thomas Nast began an aggressive campaign in the journal against the corrupt New York political leader William \"\"Boss\"\" Tweed. Nast turned down a $500,000 bribe to end his attack. Tweed was arrested in 1873 and convicted of fraud. Nast and \"\"Harper's\"\" also played an important part in securing Rutherford B. Hayes' 1876 presidential election.\n[5] Title: \"Thomas Nast\" Text:  Nast's drawings were instrumental in the downfall of Boss Tweed, the powerful Tammany Hall leader. As commissioner of public works for New York City, Tweed led a ring that by 1870 had gained total control of the city's government, and controlled \"\"a working majority in the State Legislature\"\".

Ripken continued his streak for another three years, voluntarily ending it at 2,632 consecutive games played on September 20, 1998. In 1997, the Florida Marlins won the World Series in just their fifth season. This made them the youngest expansion team to win the Fall Classic (with the exception of the 1903 Boston Red Sox and later the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks, who won in their fourth season).\n[5] Title: \"Cal Ripken Jr.\" Text:  Through 112 games, Ripken batted .315 with 13 home runs and 75s RBI before the 1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike canceled the rest of the season. Ripken's average fell to .262 in 1995; he hit 17 home runs and had 88 RBIs. However, his season highlight came on September 6. Many baseball fans within and outside of the United States tuned into ESPN to watch Ripken surpass Lou Gehrig's 56-year-old record for consecutive games played (2,130 games). The game, between the Orioles and the California Angels, still ranks as one of the network's most watched baseball games (baseball's most-watched game was Game 7 of the 1986 World Series).\nQuestion: who is closest to cal ripken jr record\nYour answer: ",

Note that in China the new year, when the sexagenary count increments, is not January 1, but rather the lunar new year of the traditional Chinese calendar. For example, the ji-chou year (coinciding roughly with 2009) began on January 26, 2009. (However, for astrology, the year begins with the first solar term \"\"L\u00ecch\u016bn\"\" (), which occurs near February 4.)\n[2] Title: \"Chinese astrology\" Text:  For this reason, many online sign calculators (and Chinese restaurant place mats) may give a person the wrong sign if he/she was born in January or early February. The start of a new zodiac is also celebrated on Chinese New Year along with many other customs. The following table shows the 60-year cycle matched up to the Western calendar for the years 1924\u20132043 (see sexagenary cycle article for years 1804\u20131923). This is only applied to Chinese Lunar calendar. The sexagenary cycle begins at lichun 'about February 4' according to some astrological sources.\n[3] Title: \"Sexagenary cycle\" Text:  The year starts with the new year of whoever is using the calendar. In China, the cyclic year normally changes on the Chinese Lunar New Year. In Japan until recently it was the Japanese lunar new year, which was sometimes different from the Chinese; now it is January 1. So when calculating the cyclic year of a date in the Gregorian year, one have to consider what their \"\"new year\"\" is. Hence, the following calculation deals with the Chinese dates \"\"after\"\" the Lunar New Year in that Gregorian year; to find the corresponding sexagenary year in the dates before the Lunar New Year would require the Gregorian year to be decreased by 1.\n[4] Title: Zigong Text:  As a measure to promote the city, the lantern show has already been brought to many cities in mainland China and even southeast Asia throughout of the years. Since China is on a Lunar calendar - known in the west as the Chinese calendar, Spring Festival - which is also known as Chinese New Year will vary each year on a Gregorian calendar - but is roughly between January 16 and February 19 each year - depending on which of the Twelve earthly branches it is currently. The Lantern Festival has been going on since the Tang dynasty and gets more elaborate each year and is certainly a sight to behold.\n[5] Title: \"Chinese school\" Text:  Chinese New Year celebrations traditionally run from Chinese New Year's Eve, the last day of the last month of the Chinese calendar, to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first month, making the festival the longest in the Chinese calendar. The first day of the New Year falls between January 21 and February 20. Other cultures and languages have similar setups. For example: Chinese school A Chinese school () is a school that is established for the purpose of teaching the varieties of Chinese (in particular, Mandarin and Cantonese), though the purpose can vary to teaching different aspects of Chinese culture such as Chinese art, calligraphy, history and martial arts.\nQuestion: chinese new year what is it the year of\nYour answer: ",

Rat takes some pistols and a cudgel and hurries along to the Wild Wood to find him. After Rat finds Mole, they literally stumble across Badger's house (Mole hurts his foot on Badger's door scraper buried in the snow) and knocks on the door.

Nevertheless, on a snowy winter's day, while the seasonally somnolent Rat dozes, Mole impulsively goes to the Wild Wood to explore, hoping to meet Badger. He gets lost in the woods, sees many \"\"evil faces\"\" among the wood's less-welcoming denizens, succumbs to fright and panic and hides, trying to stay warm, among the sheltering roots of a tree.\n[4] Title: \"The Wind in the Willows (1983 film)\" Text:  In winter, Rat and Mole are extremely worried and they decide to call on Badger to see if he has any suggestions; if there's anyone Toad will listen to, it is Badger. But Rat fell asleep, refusing to take Mole to the Wild Wood. Mole then decides to go alone to the Wild Wood to see Badger. He asks a henchman weasel for directions to Badger's house, but he tells Mole the wrong way to go and he becomes lost and scared when the Weasels stalk him.

However, tension arose between songwriter Noel Gallagher and his younger brother, lead singer Liam, when Noel wanted to sing lead vocals on either \"\"Wonderwall\"\" or \"\"Don't Look Back in Anger\"\". The younger Gallagher considered this tantamount to a temporary exile from his own group. The issue dissipated momentarily as Noel was pleased with Liam's vocal take of \"\"Wonderwall\"\".

It was introduced in April 2003 and is a means-tested benefit. Despite their name, tax credits are not to be confused with tax credits linked to a person's tax bill, because they are used to top-up wages. Unlike most other benefits, it is paid by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). WTC can be claimed by working individuals, childless couples and working families with dependent children.\n[2] Title: \"Working Tax Credit\" Text:  It was introduced in April 2003 and is a means-tested benefit. Despite their name, tax credits are not to be confused with tax credits\n[3] Title: \"Working Tax Credit\" Text:  The WFTC was itself a transitional system from the earlier benefit for working families known as Family Credit (FC), which had been in operation since 1986. The WFTC shared its assessment of means and period of renewal (6 months) with FC but moved towards a tax credit approach styled on schemes in other countries, which used an annual declaration of income to assess entitlement for a whole year. Tax credits also replaced the child elements in means tested benefits, the Children's Tax Credit in the tax system, and disabled persons tax credit.\n[4] Title: \"Working Tax Credit\" Text:  This led to significant levels of overpayments. In order to reduce the overpayment problem, the income disregard was raised tenfold from \u00a32,500 to \u00a325,000 with effect from 2006/07. Income for tax credit purposes is \"\"in principle\"\" assessed similarly to UK income tax. Thus 'income' (c/f 'taxable income') consists of what the individual receives from gross earned and unearned sources\u2014less allowances for 'expenditures' that would reduce that income. But, unlike income tax, tax credits measure income based on family 'household', rather than the individuals within.\n[5] Title: \"Working Tax Credit\" Text:  Also the effect of \"\"income disregard\"\" \u2014to mask large annual increases in resources from reassessment\u2014 weakens comparisons with a \"\"true\"\" income tax still further. By comparison with other means tested benefits, the income treatment of claimants of tax credits is especially generous; it permits deduction of the full gross amount (rather than 50% net)of any individual pension contributions and any Gift aid payments. Since increases in income are subject to withdrawal at 39%(in the initial range), such reductions are effectively 'rebated' at the same rate through the tax credits received.\nQuestion: when did the working income tax benefit come into effect\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: Mixture Text:  Mixture In chemistry, a mixture is a material made up of two or more different substances which are mixed. A mixture refers to the physical combination of two or more substances in which the identities are retained and are mixed in the form of solutions, suspensions and colloids. Mixtures are one product of mechanically blending or mixing chemical substances such as elements and compounds, without chemical bonding or other chemical change, so that each ingredient substance retains its own chemical properties and makeup. Despite that there are no chemical changes to its constituents, the physical properties of a mixture, such as its melting point, may differ from those of the components.\n[2] Title: Mixture Text:  Some mixtures can be separated into their components by using physical (mechanical or thermal) means. Azeotropes are one kind of mixture that usually pose considerable difficulties regarding the separation processes required to obtain their constituents (physical or chemical processes or, even a blend of them). Mixtures can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous. A homogeneous mixture is a type of mixture in which the composition is uniform and every part of the solution has the same properties. Examples of homogeneous mixtures include alloys and alcohol in water. A heterogeneous mixture is a type of mixture in which the components can be seen, as there are two or more phases present.\n[3] Title: Mixture Text:  One example of a mixture is air. Air is a homogeneous mixture of the gaseous substances nitrogen, oxygen, and smaller amounts of other substances. Salt, sugar, and many other substances dissolve in water to form homogeneous mixtures. A homogeneous mixture in which there is both a solute and solvent present is also a solution. Mixtures can have any amounts of ingredients. The following table shows the main properties of the three families of mixtures and examples of the three tpes of mixture. A \"\"heterogeneous mixture\"\" is a mixture of two or more chemical substances (elements or compounds).\n[4] Title: Solution Text:  Solution In chemistry, a solution is a special type of homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances. The term aqueous solution is when one of the solvents is water. In such a mixture, a solute is a substance dissolved in another substance, known as a solvent. The mixing process of a solution happens at a scale where the effects of chemical polarity are involved, resulting in interactions that are specific to solvation. The solution assumes the phase of the solvent when the solvent is the larger fraction of the mixture, as is commonly the case.\n[5] Title: Mixture Text:  Examples are: mixtures of sand and water or sand and iron filings, a conglomerate rock, water and oil, a portion salad, trail mix, and concrete (not cement). A mixture of powdered silver metal and powdered gold metal would represent a heterogeneous mixture of two elements. Making a distinction between \"\"homogeneous\"\" and \"\"heterogeneous\"\" mixtures is a matter of the scale of sampling. On a coarse enough scale, any mixture can be said to be homogeneous, if the entire article is allowed to count as a \"\"sample\"\" of it.\nQuestion: what are the two types of mixtures in science\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Piracy in the Caribbean\" Text:  Piracy in the Caribbean ]The era of piracy in the Caribbean began in the 1500s and phased out in the 1830s after the navies of the nations of Western Europe and North America with colonies in the Caribbean began combating pirates. The period during which pirates were most successful was from the 1660s to 1730s. Piracy flourished in the Caribbean because of the existence of pirate seaports such as Port Royal in Jamaica, Tortuga in Haiti, and Nassau in the Bahamas. Piracy in the Caribbean was part of a larger historical phenomenon of piracy, as it existed close to major trade and exploration routes in nearly all the five oceans.\n[2] Title: Piracy Text:  The classic era of piracy in the Caribbean lasted from circa 1650 until the mid-1720s. By 1650, France, England and the United Provinces began to develop their colonial empires. This involved considerable seaborne trade, and a general economic improvement: there was money to be made\u2014or stolen\u2014and much of it traveled by ship. French buccaneers were established on northern Hispaniola as early as 1625, but lived at first mostly as hunters rather than robbers; their transition to full-time piracy was gradual and motivated in part by Spanish efforts to wipe out both the buccaneers and the prey animals on which they depended.\n[3] Title: \"Piracy in the Caribbean\" Text:  The Dutch also had set up a settlement on the island of Saint Martin which became another haven for Dutch sugar planters and their African slave labor. In 1648, the Dutch agreed to divide the prosperous island in half with the French. The late 17th and early 18th centuries (particularly between the years 1716 to 1726) are often considered the \"\"Golden Age of Piracy\"\" in the Caribbean, and pirate ports experienced rapid growth in the areas in and surrounding the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Furthermore, during this time period there were approximately 2400 men that were currently active pirates.\n[4] Title: \"Early modern period\" Text:  Another factor was the centuries-long conflict between the Iberians and the Muslims to the south. The Golden Age of Piracy is a designation given to one or more outbursts of piracy in the early modern period, spanning from the mid-17th century to the mid-18th century. The buccaneering period covers approximately the late 17th century. The period is characterized by Anglo-French seamen based on Jamaica and Tortuga attacking Spanish colonies and shipping in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. A sailing route known as the Pirate Round was followed by certain Anglo-American pirates at the turn of the 18th century, associated with long-distance voyages from Bermuda and the Americas to rob Muslim and East India Company targets in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea.\n[5] Title: \"Piracy in the Caribbean\" Text:  In short, Europe was consumed in the final decades of the 17th century by nearly constant dynastic intrigue and warfare\u2014an opportune time for pirates and privateers to engage in their bloody trade. In the Caribbean, this political environment led colonial governors to face new threats from every direction. The Dutch sugar island of Sint Eustatius changed ownership ten times between 1664 and 1674 as the English and Dutch dueled for supremacy. Consumed with the various wars in Europe, the mother countries provided few further military reinforcements to their colonies, so the colonial governors of the Caribbean increasingly made use of buccaneers as mercenaries and privateers to guard their colonies or carry the fight to their mother country's current enemy.\nQuestion: time period of the pirates of the caribbean\nYour answer: ",

Allen was driving with his Dutch girlfriend, Miriam Barendsen, when his Corvette swerved off the road on a sharp bend and went through a drystone wall. Despite the severity of the accident, Allen was committed to continuing his role as Def Leppard's drummer, and realised that he could use his legs to do some of the drumming work previously done with his arms.\n[2] Title: \"Hysteria (Def Leppard album)\" Text:  On 31 December 1984, Rick Allen lost his left arm when his Corvette flipped off a country road. Following the accident, the band stood by Allen's decision to return to the drum kit despite his disability, using a combination electronic/acoustic kit with a set of electronic pedals that triggered (via MIDI) the sounds that he would have played with his left arm. The band slowly continued production until Lange unexpectedly returned a year later, and Allen mastered his customised drum kit. However, the sessions were further delayed by Lange's own auto accident (sustaining leg injuries from which he quickly recovered) and a bout of the mumps suffered by singer Joe Elliott in 1986.\n[3] Title: \"Hysteria (Def Leppard album)\" Text:  The title of the album was thought up by drummer Rick Allen, referring to his 1984 auto accident and the ensuing worldwide media coverage surrounding it. It is also the last album to feature guitarist Steve Clark before his death, although songs co-written by him would appear on the band's next album, \"\"Adrenalize\"\". The album is the follow-up to the band's 1983 breakthrough \"\"Pyromania\"\". \"\"Hysteria\"\"s creation took over three years and was plagued by delays, including the aftermath of drummer Rick Allen\u2019s accident that cost him his left arm on New year\u2019s eve of 31 December, 1984.\n[4] Title: \"Rick Allen (drummer)\" Text:  In September 1979, they opened for Sammy Hagar at London's Hammersmith Odeon.

In the 1950s, the first two words, \"\"Cum Deo\"\" (\"\"i.e. \"\", \"\"With God\"\"), were removed for ideological reasons; in 1989, they were restored.\n[2] Title: \"Statue of Liberty\" Text:  The erected statue does stride over a broken chain, half-hidden by her robes and difficult to see from the ground. Bartholdi was initially uncertain of what to place in Liberty's left hand; he settled on a \"\"tabula ansata\"\", used to evoke the concept of law. Though Bartholdi greatly admired the United States Constitution, he chose to inscribe \"\"JULY IV MDCCLXXVI\"\" on the tablet, thus associating the date of the country's Declaration of Independence with the concept of liberty. Bartholdi interested his friend and mentor, architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, in the project.\n[3] Title: \"Statue of Liberty\" Text:  According to sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi, who later recounted the story, Laboulaye's comment was not intended as a proposal, but it inspired Bartholdi. Given the repressive nature of the regime of Napoleon III, Bartholdi took no immediate action on the idea except to discuss it with Laboulaye. Bartholdi was in any event busy with other possible projects; in the late 1860s, he approached Isma'il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, with a plan to build \"\"Progress\"\" or \"\"Egypt Carrying the Light to Asia\"\", a huge lighthouse in the form of an ancient Egyptian female \"\"fellah\"\" or peasant, robed and holding a torch aloft, at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal in Port Said.\n[4] Title: \"Statue of Liberty\" Text:  French monarchists opposed the statue, if for no other reason than it was proposed by the liberal Laboulaye, who had recently been elected a senator for life. Laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to the rich and powerful, including a special performance at the Paris Opera on April 25, 1876, that featured a new cantata by composer Charles Gounod. The piece was titled \"\"La Libert\u00e9 \u00e9clairant le monde\"\", the French version of the statue's announced name. Initially focused on the elites, the Union was successful in raising funds from across French society.\n[5] Title: \"Miss Liberty\" Text:  Miss Liberty Miss Liberty is a 1949 Broadway musical with a book by Robert E. Sherwood and music and lyrics by Irving Berlin. It is based on the sculpting of the Statue of Liberty (\"\"Liberty Enlightening the World\"\") in 1886. The score includes the song \"\"Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor\"\", a musical setting of Emma Lazarus's sonnet \"\"The New Colossus\"\" (1883), which was placed at the base of the monument in 1903.

Prohibition began on January 16, 1920 (one year after ratification of the amendment); the manufacture, importation, sale, and transport of alcohol were prohibited, except for limited cases such as religious purposes (as with sacramental wine). But, the consumption of alcohol was never prohibited, and individuals could maintain a private stock that existed before Prohibition went into effect. Wilson moved his private supply of alcoholic beverages to the wine cellar of his Washington residence after his term of office ended.\n[2] Title: \"Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\" Text:  President Woodrow Wilson vetoed that bill, but the House of Representatives immediately voted to override the veto and the Senate voted similarly the next day. The Volstead Act set the starting date for nationwide prohibition for January 17, 1920, which was the earliest date allowed by the 18th amendment. The act was conceived and introduced by Wayne Wheeler who was a leader of the Anti-Saloon League, a group which found alcohol responsible for almost all of society's problems, and were also responsible for many campaigns against the sale of alcohol. The law was also heavily supported by Judiciary Chairman at the time, Andrew Volstead from Minnesota and was named in his honor.\n[3] Title: \"USS Conyngham (DD-58)\" Text:  She was decommissioned there on 23 June 1922. On 17 January 1920, Prohibition was instituted by law in the United States. Soon, the smuggling of alcoholic beverages along the coastlines of the United States became widespread and blatant. The Treasury Department eventually determined that the United States Coast Guard simply did not have the ships to constitute a successful patrol. To cope with the problem, President Calvin Coolidge in 1924 authorized the transfer from the Navy to the Coast Guard of twenty old destroyers that were in reserve and out of commission.\n[4] Title: \"USS Ericsson (DD-56)\" Text:  She was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 16 June 1922.

The UK premiere of the film was held on December 4, 1996, at the Royal Albert Hall, London, and the exterior of the Hall was lit with dalmatian spots.\n[3] Title: \"Cruella de Vil\" Text:  For unexplained reasons, Cruella's cat and husband were omitted from the Disney version. Cruella drives a very distinctive automobile, colored red and black, based on a 1936 Alvis Speed 20 Drophead Coupe. In the film, Cruella has become wealthy off her large collection of fur coats, and is consequentially rude and spoiled. She makes fun of Anita Radcliffe and her husband Roger for making a living from songwriting. Cruella desires to make a fur coat from the Radcliffes' Dalmatians, and promises to return in three weeks to collect the puppies when they are born.\n[4] Title: \"Cruella de Vil\" Text:  It is also believed that the inspiration for the name began in 1939 when Dodie Smith purchased a new Rolls-Royce 25/30 \"\"Sedanca de Ville\"\" motorcar in which she and her pet Dalmatian \"\"Pongo\"\" frequently travelled, which also formed the basis of the cartoon imagery of Cruella's own motorcar.

Murphy and Falchuk created the anthology series \"\"American Horror Story\"\", which premiered on FX on October 5, 2011. Some of the same cast have played different characters in different settings each subsequent season. In October 2014, FX greenlit a companion anthology series, \"\"American Crime Story\"\", which Murphy and Falchuk executive produce. The series premiered on February 2, 2016. Murphy, Falchuk and Brennan next co-created the comedy-horror semi-anthology series \"\"Scream Queens\"\", which premiered on Fox on September 22, 2015.\n[2] Title: Miniseries Text:  To designate one-season shows that are not intended for being renewed for additional seasons, the broadcast and television industry came up with terms like \"\"limited series\"\" or \"\"event series\"\". These terms also apply to multi-season shows which feature rotating casts and storylines each season, such as \"\"American Horror Story\"\", \"\"Fargo\"\" and \"\"True Detective\"\". This makes the self-contained season longer than a miniseries, but shorter than the entire run of the multi-season series.

The Qur'an and the Sunnah are declared to be the country's constitution. There is no legally binding written constitution and the Qur'an and the Sunna remain subject to interpretation. This is carried out by the ulama, the Saudi religious establishment. The government of Saudi Arabia is led by the monarch, King Salman, who acceded to the throne on 23 January 2015.\n[2] Title: \"Politics of Saudi Arabia\" Text:  Politics of Saudi Arabia The politics of Saudi Arabia takes place in the context of a totalitarian absolute monarchy with Islamist lines, where the King is both the head of state and government. Decisions are, to a large extent, made on the basis of consultation among the senior princes of the royal family and the religious establishment. The Qur'an is declared to be the constitution of the country, which is governed on the basis of Islamic law (Shari'a).

Government is dominated by the royal family. The Basic Law specifies that the king must be chosen from among the sons of the first king, Abdul Aziz Al Saud, and their male descendants subject to the subsequent approval of leaders (the ulama). In 2007, an \"\"Allegiance Council\"\" was created, comprising King Abdulaziz's surviving sons plus a son of each his deceased sons, to determine who will be the heir apparent (the Crown Prince) after the previous heir apparent dies or accedes to the throne.\n[4] Title: \"Politics of Saudi Arabia\" Text:  All citizens of full age have a right to attend, meet, and petition the king directly through the traditional tribal meeting known as the majlis. Government is dominated by the vast royal family, the Al Saud, which has often been divided by internal disputes and into factions. The members of the family are the principal political actors allowed by the government. Political participation outside the royal family is limited. Saudi Arabia is one of only two countries (the other being Vatican City) that does not have a separate legislative body.\n[5] Title: \"Saudi Arabia\" Text:  Critics regard it as a totalitarian dictatorship. \"\"The Economist\"\" rated the Saudi government as the fifth most authoritarian government out of 167 rated in its 2012 Democracy Index, and Freedom House gave it its lowest \"\"Not Free\"\" rating, 7.0 (\"\"1=best, 7=worst\"\") for 2013.

The IDA lends to countries with the aim to finance projects that will develop infrastructure and improve education, healthcare, access to clean water and sanitation facilities, and environmental responsibility. It is considered to be the soft lending window of the World Bank, while the IBRD is considered to be the hard lending window. The association offers grants and loans with maturities ranging from 25 to 40 years, grace periods of 5 to 10 years, and interest rates of 2.8% or 1.25% depending on whether the borrower is a blend country and to which degree it is eligible.\n[2] Title: \"International Development Association\" Text:  Paul Hoffman, the Marshall Plan's former Administrator, proposed the idea of a soft-loan facility within the World Bank, where the US would have a preponderant voice in the allocation of such loans.Democratic Senator Mike Monroney of Oklahoma supported this idea.

Some projects were financed by a combination of a DLF soft loan and a harder World Bank loan.\n[5] Title: \"Soft loan\" Text:  Soft loan A soft loan is a loan with a below-market rate of interest. This is also known as \"\"soft financing\"\". Sometimes soft loans provide other concessions to borrowers, such as long repayment periods or interest holidays.

This contrasts with a hard loan, which has to be paid back in an agreed hard currency, usually of a country with a stable robust economy.\nQuestion: which institute is known as soft loan window of world bank\nYour answer: ",

Jacob and his sons had lived in Canaan but were forced by famine to go into Egypt for four generations, lasting 430 years, until Moses, a great-great grandson of Jacob, led the Israelites back into Canaan during the \"\"Exodus\"\".

It is composed of the Hawaiian ridge, consisting of the islands of the Hawaiian chain northwest to Kure Atoll, and the Emperor Seamounts: together they form a vast underwater mountain region of islands and intervening seamounts, atolls, shallows, banks and reefs along a line trending southeast to northwest beneath the northern Pacific Ocean. The seamount chain, containing over 80 identified undersea volcanoes, stretches over from the Aleutian Trench in the far northwest Pacific to the Lo\u02bbihi seamount, the youngest volcano in the chain, which lies about southeast of the Island of Hawai\u02bbi.\n[2] Title: \"Shield volcano\" Text:  The largest and most prominent shield volcano chain in the world is the Hawaiian Islands, a chain of hotspot volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean. The Hawaiian volcanoes are characterized by frequent rift eruptions, their large size (thousands of km in volume), and their rough, decentralized shape. Rift zones are a prominent feature on these volcanoes, and account for their seemingly random volcanic structure. They are fueled by the movement of the Pacific Plate over the Hawaii hotspot, and form a long chain of volcanoes, atolls, and seamounts long with a total volume of over .\n[3] Title: \"Evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes\" Text:  Evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes The fifteen volcanoes that make up the eight principal islands of Hawaii are the youngest in a chain of more than 129 volcanoes that stretch across the North Pacific Ocean, called the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain. Hawaii's volcanoes rise an average of to reach sea level from their base. The largest, Mauna Loa, is high. As shield volcanoes, they are built by accumulated lava flows, growing a few meters/feet at a time to form a broad and gently sloping shape. Hawaiian islands undergo a systematic pattern of submarine and subaerial growth that is followed by erosion.\n[4] Title: \"Hawaiian\u2013Emperor seamount chain\" Text:  The chain can be divided into three subsections. The first, the Hawaiian archipelago (also known as the \"\"Windward isles\"\"), consists of the islands comprising the U.S. state of Hawaii. As it is the closest to the hotspot, this volcanically active region is the youngest part of the chain, with ages ranging from 400,000 years to 5.1 million years. The island of Hawaii is composed of five volcanoes, of which three (Kilauea, Mauna Loa, and Hualalai) are still active. Haleakal\u0101 on the island of Maui is dormant.\n[5] Title: \"Ki\u0304lauea\" Text:  In 1916, a bill forming the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson; since then, the park has become a World Heritage Site and a major tourist destination, attracting roughly 2.6 million people annually. Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, K\u012blauea was created as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's underlying mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the -long Hawaiian\u2013Emperor seamount chain. The prevailing, though not completely settled, view is that the hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, if not all of the Cenozoic Era.\nQuestion: what is the phenomenon responsible for the island chain of hawaii\nYour answer: ",

When this play was put on, this scene was accomplished using the \"\"mechane\"\" device usually reserved for the appearance of a god or goddess. She confronts Jason, reveling in his pain at being unable to ever hold his children again: She escapes to Athens with the bodies.

Hesiod's Theogony places her marriage to Jason on the list of marriages between mortals and divine, suggesting that she is predominantly divine. She also has connections with the Hecate, who was the goddess of magic, which could be one of the main sources of which she draws her magical ties. Medea's role began after Jason came from Iolcus to Colchis, to claim his inheritance and throne by retrieving the Golden Fleece.\n[3] Title: \"Medea (play)\" Text:  Medea (play) Medea (, \"\"M\u0113deia\"\") is an ancient Greek tragedy written by Euripides, based upon the myth of Jason and Medea and first produced in 431 BC. The plot centers on the actions of Medea, a former princess of the \"\"barbarian\"\" kingdom of Colchis, and the wife of Jason; she finds her position in the Greek world threatened as Jason leaves her for a Greek princess of Corinth. Medea takes vengeance on Jason by murdering Jason's new wife as well as her own children, after which she escapes to Athens to start a new life.\n[4] Title: \"Medea (play)\" Text:  In conflict with this sympathetic undertone (or reinforcing a more negative reading) is Medea's barbarian identity, which would antagonize a 5th-century Greek audience. \"\"Medea\"\" is centered on a wife\u2019s calculated desire for revenge against her unfaithful husband. The play is set in Corinth some time after Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece, where he met Medea. The play begins with Medea in a blind rage towards Jason for arranging to marry Glauce, the daughter of Creon (king of Corinth). The nurse, overhearing Medea\u2019s grief, fears what she might do to herself or her children.\n[5] Title: \"Medea (1969 film)\" Text:  The Argonauts hastily depart from Colchis, with horsemen from her village in hot pursuit. When the Colchians begin closing in, Medea kills her brother and dismembers his body, in a manner similar to the sacrificial victim of the \"\"sparagmos\"\" ritual earlier. Her father's men are then forced to halt and retrieve the scattered pieces of his son's body, enabling Jason and Medea to escape.

An F3 tornado in St. John the Baptist Parish damaged or destroyed 163 structures. 17 fatalities were reported in Louisiana, six of which were drowning victims offshore. Elsewhere, the storm spawned at least 28 tornadoes, especially in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. Overall, Andrew caused 65 fatalities and $27.3 billion (1992 USD) in damage, making it the eighth-costliest hurricane in U.S. history, behind Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Hurricane Ike in 2008, Hurricane Sandy in 2012, hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria in 2017, and Hurricane Florence in 2018.\n[2] Title: \"History of the United States (1991\u20132008)\" Text:  3,600 fires were set, destroying over 1,000 buildings and widespread looting occurred, especially of businesses owned by Korean Americans.

On 27 September 1992, the 10th Mountain Division assumed responsibility for Hurricane Andrew disaster relief as Task Force Mountain. Division soldiers set up relief camps, distributed food, clothing, medical necessities and building supplies, as well as helping to rebuild homes and clear debris. The last of the 6,000 division soldiers deployed to Florida returned home in October 1992.\n[4] Title: \"1992 Atlantic hurricane season\" Text:  A strong mid-latitude trough turned Andrew northward, where it greatly weakened before hitting west of Morgan City, Louisiana on August 26 as a Category 3 hurricane. It turned northeastward, and dissipated over Tennessee on August 28. In the Bahamas, Andrew brought high tides, hurricane-force winds, and tornadoes, which caused significant damage in the archipelago, especially on Cat Cays.

WKRP had two musical themes, one opening and the other closing the show. The opening theme, a soft rock/pop number called \"\"WKRP In Cincinnati Main Theme,\"\" was composed by Tom Wells, with lyrics by series creator Hugh Wilson, and was performed by Steve Carlisle. An urban legend circulated at the time that Richard Sanders (who had comparable vocal characteristics to Carlisle) had recorded the song.\n[2] Title: \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" Text:  Wilson stated in the commentary for the first season's DVD set that this was not true. Sanders would later \"\"sing\"\" the lyrics in a promo spot on VH1 for \"\"The New WKRP in Cincinnati\"\", which parodied the U2 song, \"\"Numb.\"\" A full-length version of the original theme song was released in 1979 on a 45 rpm vinyl single on the MCA Records label. It peaked at 65 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1981 and at 29 on the Adult Contemporary chart in 1982.\n[3] Title: \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" Text:  The lyrics refer to the life of character Andy Travis, who actually casually recites part of the lyrics as dialogue in one episode, The Creation of Venus. The closing theme, \"\"WKRP In Cincinnati End Credits,\"\" was a hard rock number composed and performed by Jim Ellis, an Atlanta musician who recorded some of the incidental music for the show. According to people who attended the recording sessions, Ellis didn't yet have lyrics for the closing theme, so he improvised a semi-comprehensible story about a bartender to give an idea of how the finished theme would sound.\n[4] Title: \"The New WKRP in Cincinnati\" Text:  The familiar opening and closing themes of its parent series were retained, while a new arrangement/recording was used for the opening theme, the closing theme was the same version heard on the original series (although a bit faster). The series followed up on some details left unaddressed in the original series. For example, the actual frequency of WKRP was never revealed in the original series. (Promos for the original series had noted, without specifying a frequency, that the station used the highest available frequency on the AM dial (at the time, before the AM expanded band was opened, this was 1600 AM, a frequency unused in southern Ohio until 1995.)\n[5] Title: \"WOLD (song)\" Text:  The lyrics go on to reveal that perhaps we can never change who we really are, and that what he had really wanted was the love and companionship that had eluded him in a previous failed relationship.

The first person to use the word \"\"geography\"\" was Eratosthenes (276\u2013194 BC). However, there is evidence for recognizable practices of geography, such as cartography (or map-making) prior to the use of the term geography.\n[3] Title: \"History of cartography\" Text:  He was also the first person to use the word \"\"geography\"\". Claudius Ptolemy (90\u2013168) thought that, with the aid of astronomy and mathematics, the earth could be mapped very accurately. Ptolemy revolutionized the depiction of the spherical earth on a map by using perspective projection, and suggested precise methods for fixing the position of geographic features on its surface using a coordinate system with parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude. Ptolemy's eight-volume atlas \"\"Geographia\"\" is a prototype of modern mapping and GIS.\n[4] Title: Eratosthenes Text:  Eratosthenes Eratosthenes of Cyrene (; , ; \u2013 ) was a Greek mathematician, geographer, poet, astronomer, and music theorist. He was a man of learning, becoming the chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria. He invented the discipline of geography, including the terminology used today. He is best known for being the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth, which he did by comparing altitudes of the mid-day sun at two places a known North-South distance apart. His calculation was remarkably accurate. He was also the first to calculate the tilt of the Earth's axis, again with remarkable accuracy.\n[5] Title: \"Library of Alexandria\" Text:  Eratosthenes was the first person to advance geography towards becoming a scientific discipline. Eratosthenes believed that the setting of the Homeric poems was purely imaginary and argued that the purpose of poetry was \"\"to capture the soul\"\", rather than to give a historically accurate account of actual events. Strabo quotes him as having sarcastically commented, \"\"a man might find the places of Odysseus's wanderings if the day were to come when he would find the leatherworker who stitched the goatskin of the winds.\"\" Meanwhile, other scholars at the Library of Alexandria also displayed interest in scientific subjects.\nQuestion: the first person to use the word geography was\nYour answer: ",

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Quebec Winter Carnival\" Text:  Quebec Winter Carnival The Quebec Winter Carnival (), commonly known in both English and French as Carnaval, is a pre-Lenten festival held in Quebec City. After being held intermittently since 1894, the \"\"Carnaval de Qu\u00e9bec\"\" has been celebrated annually since 1955. That year \"\"Bonhomme Carnaval\"\", the mascot of the festival, made his first appearance. Up to one million people attended the \"\"Carnaval de Qu\u00e9bec\"\" in 2006 making it, at the time, the largest winter festival in the world (since overtaken by the Harbin Festival).\n[2] Title: \"Quebec Winter Carnival\" Text:  The most famous attractions of this winter festival are the night-time and daytime parades led by mascot Bonhomme Carnaval. The parades wind through the upper city, decorated for the occasion with lights and ice sculptures. Numerous public and private parties, shows and balls are held across the city, some of them outside in the bitter cold, testimony to the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois' fabled joie de vivre. Other major events include: Outdoor dance parties are held at the Ice Palaces. Also not part of the official program but worth a visit or a stay, the Quebec City Ice Hotel is open every year from early January to late March with its bar, nightclub, exhibition galleries and ceremonial chapel.\n[3] Title: Carnival Text:  The party officially takes six days, but can continue for more than that. Caribana, held in Toronto on the first weekend of August, has its origins in Caribbean Carnival traditions. To take advantage of more comfortable weather, Caribana is held in the summer. Attendance at the parade typically exceeds one million. The Quebec Winter Carnival is the biggest winter-themed Carnival in the world. It depends on snowfall and very cold weather, to keep snowy ski trails in good condition and ice sculptures frozen. The carnival is held during the last days of January and first days of February.\n[4] Title: \"Mattice-Val Co\u0302te\u0301\" Text:  It had been abandoned in the 1940s but has now been cleaned up and can be accessed by road or by canoe on the Missinaibi River.

Activities include snowmobile rallies, music concerts, and kids activities. The Carnaval is best known in the area for its generous prizes (vehicles and money) given away in the Carnival draw. The first \"\"journ\u00e9es m\u00e9di\u00e9vales\"\" (Medieval Days) took place in the summer of 2006, inspired by a similar activity in a small Quebec town.\n[5] Title: \"Ice palace\" Text:  One built in 1941 had 30,000 ice blocks. St. Paul last built an ice palace in January 2018. Every year since 1954 the Quebec City Winter Carnival in Quebec City has featured ice palaces or ice castles of various sizes, depending on the budget, and has often used them to imprison briefly those persons who were judged to be too glum in this time of good cheer. Saranac Lake, New York has an annual winter carnival in which an ice palace is built. This tradition dates back to the 1897, when it was initiated to raise the spirits of tuberculosis patients who came to the town for recuperation over the long winter.\nQuestion: when did the first large winter carnival take place in quebec city\nYour answer: ",

It has its cultural roots in Mesoamerica and is widely celebrated today throughout the Americas. The girl celebrating her 15th birthday is a (; feminine form of \"\"15-year-old\"\"). In Spanish, and in Latin countries, the term \"\"quincea\u00f1era\"\" is reserved solely for the honoree; in English, primarily in the United States, the term is used to refer to the celebrations and honors surrounding the occasion.\n[2] Title: \"Quincean\u0303era\" Text:  The celebration is for Latin American girls (or \"\"Latinas\"\" in the US) who, on turning 15 are no longer considered children, and are honored and introduced into their community as young women. Contemporary festivities combine Spanish-Catholic traditions with those of Aztec and other indigenous heritages and add in a few modern twists. In ancient Mexico, the Aztecs and other indigenous peoples had many different ceremonies to mark the passage through the various stages of life. The \"\"\"\" marked a young woman's transition to adulthood, as she was presented, as a virgin, to the community for probable suitors.\n[3] Title: \"Quincean\u0303era\" Text:  The meaning behind the \"\" has become more refined over time and has been adapted by various Latino cultures in relation to where they are living. In the Southern Cone, the custom was popularized by European immigrants. In rural societies, girls were considered ready for marriage once they turned 15. In the 20th century, the ' received certain privileges associated with womanhood: permission to attend adult parties, pluck her eyebrows and shave her legs, wear makeup, jewelry and high heels. When this tradition originated, the ' was a small party to celebrate the transition.\n[4] Title: \"Quincean\u0303era\" Text:  This shows the increasing influence of Hispanic and Latino culture within the broader American culture. The increasing popularity of the celebration has begun to lead to an uptick in retailers and businesses catering directly to young Hispanic or Latina women.

Each passage is indicated by a numerical identifier [].\nHere are the related passages for your reference.\n[1] Title: \"Cellular respiration\" Text:  The potential of NADH and FADH is converted to more ATP through an electron transport chain with oxygen as the \"\"terminal electron acceptor\"\". Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation. This works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane. This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate group. Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration (2 from glycolysis, 2 from the Krebs cycle, and about 34 from the electron transport system).\n[2] Title: \"Adenosine diphosphate\" Text:  Oxidative phosphorylation produces 26 of the 30 equivalents of ATP generated in cellular respiration by transferring electrons from NADH or FADH2 to O2 through electron carriers. The energy released when electrons are passed from higher-energy NADH or FADH2 to the lower-energy O2 is required to phosphorylate ADP and once again generate ATP. It is this energy coupling and phosphorylation of ADP to ATP that gives the electron transport chain the name oxidative phosphorylation. During the initial phases of glycolysis and the TCA cycle, cofactors such as NAD+ donate and accept electrons that aid in the electron transport chain's ability to produce a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n[3] Title: \"Cellular respiration\" Text:  In eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondrial cristae. It comprises the electron transport chain that establishes a proton gradient (chemiosmotic potential) across the boundary of inner membrane by oxidizing the NADH produced from the Krebs cycle. ATP is synthesized by the ATP synthase enzyme when the chemiosmotic gradient is used to drive the phosphorylation of ADP. The electrons are finally transferred to exogenous oxygen and, with the addition of two protons, water is formed. The table below describes the reactions involved when one glucose molecule is fully oxidized into carbon dioxide.\n[4] Title: \"Electrochemical gradient\" Text:  The final step of cellular respiration is the electron transport chain. Four complexes embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion make up the electron transport chain. However, only complexes I, III, and IV pump protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space (IMS). In total, there are ten protons translocated from the matrix to the IMS which generates an electrochemical potential of more than 200mV. This drives the flux of protons back into the matrix through ATP synthase which produces ATP by adding an inorganic phosphate to ADP.\n[5] Title: \"ATP synthase\" Text:  ATP synthase ATP synthase is an enzyme that creates the energy storage molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the most commonly used \"\"energy currency\"\" of cells for all organisms. It is formed from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P). The overall reaction catalyzed by ATP synthase is: The formation of ATP from ADP and P is energetically unfavorable and would normally proceed in the reverse direction. In order to drive this reaction forward, ATP synthase couples ATP synthesis during cellular respiration to an electrochemical gradient created by the difference in proton (H) concentration across the mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes or the plasma membrane in bacteria.\nQuestion: most of the atp produced during cellular respiration is produced by\nYour answer: ",

Two premises are not enough to connect four different terms, since in order to establish connection, there must be one term common to both premises. In everyday reasoning, the fallacy of four terms occurs most frequently by equivocation: using the same word or phrase but with a different meaning each time, creating a fourth term even though only three distinct words are used: The word \"\"nothing\"\" in the example above has two meanings, as presented: \"\"nothing is better\"\" means the thing being named has the highest value possible; \"\"better than nothing\"\" only means that the thing being described has some value.\n[2] Title: Conflation Text:  For example, the word \"\"bat\"\" has at least two distinct meanings: a flying animal, and a piece of sporting equipment (such as a baseball bat or cricket bat). If these meanings are not distinguished, the result may be the following categorical syllogism, which may be seen as a joke (pun): Using words with different meanings can help clarify, or can cause real confusion. English words with multiple (verb) meanings can be illustrated by instances in which a motion is merged with or a causation with manner, e.g.\n[3] Title: \"De Interpretatione\" Text:  However, if a word has two meanings, for example if the word 'garment' meant 'man and horse', then 'the garment is white' would not be a single affirmation, for it would mean 'the man and horse are white', which is equivalent to the two simple propositions 'a man is white and a horse is white'. \"\"Chapter 9\"\". Of contradictory propositions about the past and present, one must be true, the other false. But when the subject is individual, and the proposition is future, this is not the case.\n[4] Title: \"Meaning (philosophy of language)\" Text:  In his paper \"\"\u00dcber Sinn und Bedeutung\"\" (now usually translated as \"\"On Sense and Reference\"\"), Gottlob Frege argued that proper names present at least two problems in explaining meaning. Frege can be interpreted as arguing that it was therefore a mistake to think that the meaning of a name is the thing it refers to. Instead, the meaning must be something else\u2014the \"\"sense\"\" of the word. Two names for the same person, then, can have different senses (or meanings): one referent might be picked out by more than one sense.\n[5] Title: \"Open-question argument\" Text:  can be meaningful. Ergo premise 1 does not hold and the argument falls. Sense and reference are two different aspects of some terms' meanings. A term's \"\"reference\"\" is the \"\"object\"\" to which the term refers, while the term's \"\"sense\"\" is the \"\"way\"\" that the term refers to that object. There is a difference between the sense of a term and its reference (i.e. the object itself). Thus, we can understand a claim like \"\"goodness is identical with pleasure\"\" as an \"\"a posteriori\"\" identity claim similar to \"\"Water is HO\"\".\nQuestion: term for a word that has two meanings\nYour answer: ",

The season is essentially divided into two halves: Fox initially ordered only 13 episodes \u2014 the successful rescue at the end of the season's first half was planned as a series finale in the event that the show was not renewed. The show rotates between the points of view of each of the five main cast members: Jack Bauer, Teri Bauer, Nina Myers, Kim Bauer, and David Palmer, as well as one main villain \u2014 Mandy for the first three hours, followed by Ira Gaines, Andre Drazen, and finally Victor Drazen.\n[3] Title: \"24 (season 4)\" Text:  In response, Bauer fakes his own death with the help of Tony Almeida, Michelle Dessler and Chloe O'Brian.

The Four Corners area is named after the quadripoint at the intersection of approximately 37\u00b0 north latitude with 109\u00b0 03' west longitude, where the boundaries of the four states meet, and are marked by the Four Corners Monument. It is the only location in the United States where four states meet. Most of the Four Corners region belongs to semi-autonomous Native American nations, the largest of which is the Navajo Nation, followed by Hopi, Ute, and Zuni tribal reserves and nations.\n[2] Title: Quadripoint Text:  The Four Corners Monument is the only point in the United States where four states meet: Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona meet at right angles. The United States first acquired the area now called Four Corners from Mexico after the Mexican\u2013American War in 1848. In 1863 Congress created Arizona Territory from the western part of New Mexico Territory. The boundary was defined as a line running due south from the southwest corner of Colorado Territory, which had been created in 1861. By defining one boundary as starting at the corner of another Congress ensured the eventual creation of four states meeting at a point, regardless of the inevitable errors of boundary surveying.\n[3] Title: \"Four Corners Monument\" Text:  Four Corners Monument The Four Corners Monument marks the quadripoint in the Southwestern United States where the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah meet.

The monument also marks the boundary between two semi-autonomous Native American governments, the Navajo Nation, which maintains the monument as a tourist attraction, and the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe Reservation. The origins of the state boundaries marked by the monument occurred just prior to, and during, the American Civil War, when the United States Congress acted to form governments in the area to combat the spread of slavery to the region.\n[4] Title: \"Four Corners Monument\" Text:  Similar statements were issued by the Navajo Nation, defending their work in maintaining and promoting the monument. In addition, general U.S. land principles, law, and the Supreme Court have established that the location of the monument is the legal corner of the four states.
